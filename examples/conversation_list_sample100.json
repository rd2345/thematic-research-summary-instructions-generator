    "Agent:\nWelcome to XCHANGE customer support, you're speaking to [NAME]. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi [NAME], I'm [NAME] from MusicBird. I'm interested in the XCHANGE System and wondering if we can discuss setting up our products with unique serial codes.\n\nAgent:\nSure, [NAME], I'd be happy to discuss this with you. Can you provide the unique serial codes for your products?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, that's something we can definitely provide. Would it be possible to arrange a call for more details?\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely. We're based in [ADDRESS]. Could you let me know what times work for you for a call?\n\nCustomer:\nOf course, I'll have to check my schedule and get back to you on that.\n\nAgent:\nNo worries, just send over the details when you're ready.\n\nCustomer:\nWill do, thank you, [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome. Anything else I can assist with while we're on the line?\n\nCustomer:\nActually, yes. Could you explain how we can sign up as a vendor once we've got those unique codes ready?\n\nAgent:\nYep, once you have unique codes for each product, we can definitely sign you up. Each product will have its own set of codes, all distinct from each other.\n\nCustomer:\nGot it, that sounds good. I'll discuss this with my team and make sure we can generate those codes.\n\nAgent:\nPerfect. I look forward to hearing from you, [NAME]. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions.\n\nCustomer:\nI will, thanks a lot for your help, [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nMy pleasure, have a great day!\n\nCustomer:\nYou too, bye.",
    "Agent:\nThank you for calling MusicBird support, how can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I need the link to the Chord Library you guys offer. I heard it's got 62 MIDI templates?\n\nAgent:\nSure, I can help with that. Have you clicked on the \"Give me the library\" button in our email?\n\nCustomer:\nI got an email talking about the Chord Library but there wasn't a link or button.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, I'll send you the link directly. You should be able to download it on your desktop and drag it into your software. Also, are you by any chance a music producer interested in learning to play the keyboard?\n\nCustomer:\nYes I'm interested.\n\nAgent:\nAwesome! We have a new software on how to learn the keyboard for producers. Would you like early access?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, that would be great.\n\nAgent:\nGreat! The product isn't ready quite yet, but we'll be in touch with more details soon.\n\nCustomer:\nSounds good.\n\nAgent:\nAnd by the way, we're releasing a video update from our CEO soon about our upcoming app, MusicBird Keys.\n\nCustomer:\nI'll look out for it.\n\nAgent:\nExcellent! Since you're interested, we are offering an exclusive 30% discount for a limited time.\n\nCustomer:\nNice! I'll be sure to check the app out.\n\nAgent:\nBy the way, have you seen our new trailer for MusicBird Keys?\n\nCustomer:\nNot yet, but is MusicBird compatible with a Windows 10 laptop in S mode?\n\nAgent:\nHi [NAME], MusicBird works with Windows 10 but let me just check about S mode for you, one moment.\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I meant Windows 10 in S mode, sorry about the typo.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, I got you. MusicBird should work fine, but we haven't tested it specifically in S mode. Feel free to download it for free and see how it goes.\n\nCustomer:\nOk. I'm thinking to buy a gateway 11 flip, and I wanted to check if I can use MusicBird on it. Chromebooks don't support it, so I'm checking before I purchase.\n\nAgent:\nIf it runs the same OS as Microsoft Surface, then it should work fine as long as it\u2019s a 64-bit system.\n\nCustomer:\nYep, my friend could install it on her Surface. The gateway I want seems to be 64-bit too, so I'm going to buy it and I'll let you know if it works.",
    "Agent:\nHi [NAME], thank you for contacting MusicBird support, my name is [NAME]. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHey [NAME], I saw an ad about a Chord Library and I clicked on \"Give me the library\" but I haven't received anything yet.\n\nAgent:\nGreat! I can certainly help with that. Could you please confirm the email address you used so I can check our system for you?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, it's [EMAIL_ADDRESS]\n\nAgent:\nGot it. Give me one moment to pull up your information.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks.\n\nAgent:\nYep, here it is. I found your request for the Chord Library. I am sending you the file link now. Make sure you download it on your desktop computer and then drag the MIDI templates into your production software.\n\nCustomer:\nReceived it, thanks! That was quick.\n\nAgent:\nFantastic! By the way, are you a music producer looking to learn to play the keyboard?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I'm interested.\n\nAgent:\nAwesome. We're actually releasing a new software soon to help music producers learn the keyboard quickly. Would you like early access?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, not at the moment.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, no problem. If you change your mind, just send us a message.\n\nCustomer:\nI will do, thank you.\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome. Oh, and before I forget, our CEO [NAME] has a special video update about our upcoming app, MusicBird Keys. Would you be interested in taking a look?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, please send that over.\n\nAgent:\nDone! Please check your email for the video update. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's everything. Thanks for the help!\n\nAgent:\nMy pleasure, [NAME]. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions. Have a great day!\n\nCustomer:\nYou too, bye.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for calling MusicBird Support, this is [NAME] speaking. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm interested in your service, but I'm on a tight budget. My name's [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nHi [NAME], I totally understand budget concerns. We do have a couple of special offers that might help. There's a 30% discount for the first two months monthly or for the entire first year if you choose the annual plan. Would you like me to set you up with one of these discounts?\n\nCustomer:\nHmm, could you maybe offer a bit more discount? I'd be keen on the yearly subscription if so.\n\nAgent:\nI see, [NAME]. The 30% off is actually the best discount we currently have. But tell you what, I can offer you a free week to try out MusicBird and then you can decide. How does that sound?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, that could work. Especially for a hard-up Kiwi from [NAME]!\n\nAgent:\nI get that, [NAME]. I've gone ahead and enabled a week of free access for you. Enjoy, and when you're ready to subscribe, let me know and I'll get that promo code sorted for you.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, thanks [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nHello again, [NAME]. Just checking in to see how you enjoyed the free access? If you have any questions or if you're ready to subscribe, just let me know.\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, sorry for the late reply. I'm ready to take up that yearly offer now if it's still available.\n\nAgent:\nOf course, [NAME], the offer is still on the table. Give me a moment to generate the code. and here we go. Your promo code is MusicBird-YGSD151A for 30% off the first year, bringing your total to $104.92 USD. Will there be anything else I can assist you with?\n\nCustomer:\nAh, thanks. You're in [ADDRESS], right? Hang in there.\n\nAgent:\nThanks for your kindness, [NAME], yes, we're based in [ADDRESS] and doing our best. Remember, if there\u2019s anything else, just reach out.\n\nCustomer:\nYea, level 3, right. slowly getting there. All the best, you've done [ADDRESS] proud.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for calling support. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm having trouble with my Alesis Nitro kit. It's connected to my iPad with MIDI but it isn't registering any hits on the pads so I can't get my lessons to work.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had a chance to check our iPad connection guide? Also, try hitting the \"revert all mappings\" in the MusicBird settings. Could you tell me what kit you're using and if it's specific pads not working or the whole kit?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's the Alesia Nitro Mesh kit. It shows connected in the dropdown menu, but none of the pads are activating or mapping. And it's connected via USB from the unit to the iPad in.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, are you using our default mappings or a custom one? If it's a supported device, please try reverting to default by hitting the 'revert all mappings' button. Have you changed anything with your kit, like MIDI settings, or could you try a factory reset? Is GM on or off? And make sure you check your cable connections as well.\n\nCustomer:\nThe device is supported, and GM is \"On\". I already did the \"revert all\" and a factory reset. All cables are connected properly; the pads work when used with the unit alone. The drum signal just isn't coming through on MusicBird's lesson screen.\n\nAgent:\nThanks for that info, [NAME]. Are you sure your iPad is fully charged while doing this? Sometimes, power could be an issue. You could try using a higher quality USB cable and an Apple-branded adapter. We'll still need to test more on our end though. In the meantime, if none of this works, we can extend your subscription or discuss a refund if necessary.\n\nCustomer:\nNo luck with different cables and adapters. And I haven\u2019t heard back from tech support. But my kit is showing up in MusicBird, it's just not working.\n\nAgent:\nI understand and apologize for the delay. We are still investigating the compatibility between Nitro Kit and iPad. In the meantime, would you prefer a subscription extension or a refund? Let me know which option works best for you.\n\nCustomer:\nSo, we found out that the issue might be with my iPad's port. It\u2019s not as reliable anymore. And honestly, we haven't been able to use MusicBird at all. Can we arrange a refund and maybe I\u2019ll revisit this service later with updated devices?\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, [NAME]. I've gone ahead and processed that refund for you. If you do decide to try us out again in the future, let me know and I can arrange a loyalty discount for you. I'm sorry for the troubles, and thank you for your patience. Anything else I can assist with today?\n\nCustomer:\nThank you very much for all your help! That will be all.",
    "Agent:\nHello, and thank you for contacting MusicBird customer support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I cancelled my subscription a bit late, and I was charged. Since I'm not using the service, can I get a refund?\n\nAgent:\nI understand. Could you please provide me with the email associated with your MusicBird account?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, it's\n\nAgent:\nGreat, thank you. **speaking to someone else** Can you pull up this account, please? **back to customer** I'm reviewing your account details now.\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, the renewal just slipped my mind.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. It looks like your subscription was indeed auto-renewed. And you say you haven't used the service since the renewal, correct?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, that's right. Not at all.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, let me see what I can do for you.\n\nCustomer:\nI'd really appreciate that.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, I've initiated the cancellation of your account and I've processed the refund for the last payment you were charged. You should see that refund in a couple of days.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, that's great! Thank you very much.\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! If you decide to come back to us, just let us know and we'll reactivate your account for you.\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I'll keep that in mind.\n\nCustomer:\nA complication? What happened?\n\nAgent:\nIt appears the payment was disputed. Are you aware of this?\n\nCustomer:\nA dispute? No, I don't think so.\n\nAgent:\nHmm, when a charge is disputed, it means the bank has been asked to reverse the charge on your behalf. This usually happens if a customer reports an unauthorized payment.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, I did contact my bank, but I didn't mean to start a formal dispute.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, I see. Disputes can take a few weeks to resolve. We'll keep an eye on it, and if it's resolved in our favor, we'll process your refund. Otherwise, if resolved in your favor, the reversal is automatically done by your bank.\n\nCustomer:\nGot it. I'll wait for the outcome then.\n\nAgent:\nNext time feel free to reach out to us directly for a quicker resolution. We're here to help without the need for a third party.\n\nCustomer:\nWill do. Thanks for the help.\n\nAgent:\nNo problem at all. We'll contact you with any updates on the situation. Have a good day!\n\nCustomer:\nYou too, bye.",
    "Agent:\nWelcome to MusicBird support, how can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there, I wanted to know if I can still use MusicBird on my Mac if I switch from my Roland TD 17 module to a drum trigger with software like Superior Drummer 3 or EZ Drums.\n\nAgent:\nOh, okay. Are you planning to use drum triggers on an acoustic kit instead of the TD-17?\n\nCustomer:\nYep, that's what I'm considering.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. It really depends on the interface you'll use to connect the drum triggers to your Mac. Both Superior Drummer or EZ Drummer should work similarly with MusicBird if your setup is compatible.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, here's more detail: I'm thinking of replacing my Roland module with an eDrumIn 10 and using EZ Drummer on my Mac.\n\nAgent:\nAh, I see. The eDrumIn should work fine with MusicBird. On macOS, devices can connect to multiple software at once, so running MusicBird with EZ Drummer won't be an issue.\n\nCustomer:\nGreat to hear that, thank you!\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! Let us know if you need help setting it up.\n\nCustomer:\nWill do, thanks again!\n\nCustomer:\nHey, I've got everything but I'm having a bit of trouble. The eDrumIn isn't mapping well with EZ Drummer, and MusicBird is only recognizing some of my pads. Can I edit MIDI values in MusicBird?\n\nAgent:\nYou can, indeed. First, we need to see which notes your controller is sending. Could you download MIDI Monitor and hit the unrecognized parts, then tell us the MIDI notes that come up?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I'll try that and get back to you.\n\nCustomer:\nSorry for the delay. I figured out the hi-hat issue; eDrumIn now sends different MIDI for Open and Close. But I can't map the second crash. What MIDI should I use for Crash 1 and Crash 2?\n\nAgent:\nCurrently, MusicBird only has mapping for one crash and one ride, so you won't be able to map a second crash at this time.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, that's a bummer.\n\nAgent:\nI understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. If there's anything else we can help you with, please let us know.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thanks for contacting MusicBird. This is [NAME] speaking. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHello, [NAME]. I'm [NAME] from [ADDRESS]. I was checking out your subscriptions and 150 dollars is quite a lot in my currency. Do you have any local pricing or cheaper solution?\n\nAgent:\nGot it, [NAME]. I understand that the conversion rate can be a concern. Unfortunately, all our prices are set in USD and we don't offer regional pricing at the moment.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, that's a bit disappointing. Is there anything else you can do to help with the price?\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, I'd be glad to help. We do have a couple of special offers right now. Would you like to hear about them?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, please, that would be great.\n\nAgent:\nSure, we\u2019re offering a 30% discount on the first two months of the monthly subscription or 30% off your first year of an annual subscription. Would either of those interest you?\n\nCustomer:\nHmm, that\u2019s nice, but it's still a bit steep for me. I was hoping for something like a 50% discount on a 1-year subscription. Is that possible?\n\nAgent:\nI see where you\u2019re coming from, [ADDRESS]. However, the best we can do right now is the 30% discount for a year. Would you like me to generate a promo code for that?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, it's certainly better than nothing. Yeah, please generate the promo code for me.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, just a moment please.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks, I appreciate it.\n\nAgent:\nYou\u2019re welcome. Here is your promo code: MusicBird-IUYG984A for 30% off your first year. You can use that at checkout.\n\nCustomer:\nGot it, thank you! .\n\nCustomer:\nActually, I tried subscribing, but it wouldn't accept my debit card. I used a credit card instead. And I had to cancel it right after because I don't like auto-renewal payments. Just some feedback for you.\n\nAgent:\nAh, I understand. Sorry for the inconvenience with the payment method, and thanks for sharing your preference about auto-renewal. I\u2019ll pass this feedback on. As long as you're all set with your subscription, that\u2019s what matters. Is there anything else I can do for you today?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that\u2019s all. Thank you for your help, [NAME]. Have a good day!",
    "Agent:\nHello, thank you for reaching out to us.\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm having trouble accessing MusicBird for the past 3 days. It keeps saying \"Sorry there was an issue talking to our servers, please try again.\" Can you help me?\n\nAgent:\nThat's no good! I'm here to help. I recommend clearing all local data. I'll need you to close MusicBird and run a file I'm sending you. You won't lose progress, but if you've customized controls, they'll reset. You can set it up again. When you restart MusicBird, there might be a little delay as it downloads content anew. Let me know if you need assistance with this.\n\nCustomer:\nI ran the file you sent but it's still not working. I'm not sure if I did it right.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, can you try uninstalling and then reinstalling MusicBird to see if that helps? Also, do you have any VPNs enabled?\n\nCustomer:\nNo luck. And no, I'm not using any VPNs.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. I'll need some files from a folder to understand the issue better. If you could send me the contents zipped up, that'll help us identify what's wrong.\n\nCustomer:\nHere are the files from the folder. They're just text files since the last time I used MusicBird was before some updates.\n\nAgent:\nStrange, I tried resetting your password and logging in from my side, and I got the same error. Do you have another email we can try? It may solve the login problem.\n\nCustomer:\nSorry, no other email. Can you just delete my account so I can create a new one? I haven't made any purchases, so it should be fine, right?\n\nAgent:\nI found a small bug on our server and fixed it. Please try logging in with the password \"MusicBird\" and let me know if it works.\n\nCustomer:\nThe new password works, but it's still saying it can't connect to the server.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, run the file I sent you earlier again, then try logging in. If it's still an issue, I'll set up a new account for you with some free time as compensation.\n\nCustomer:\nIt didn't work, sorry. Go ahead with the new account.\n\nAgent:\nSorry about that. Can you give me another email to use for the new account? We're having issues with the original one.\n\nCustomer:\nI only have one email, so I'm not sure what to do. It's okay, I'll just not use MusicBird. Sorry for all the trouble.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, you're speaking to [NAME] at MusicBird Support. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nOh, hello [NAME]. I'm [NAME], a lecturer at Gloucestershire College. I've been exploring MusicBird after getting it with an Ableton discount and it seems like a fantastic teaching tool. I'm just wondering, do you have any plans for educational or site-wide licenses?\n\nAgent:\nI see, that's interesting. You're thinking of using it in your classes, then?\n\nCustomer:\nExactly, I work with students who are new to music theory. Many can't afford resources, so a college-funded license could be really beneficial, especially for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, that makes sense. Let me quickly see what we can do for you on that front. Just a moment.\n\nCustomer:\nThat would be amazing, thank you!\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! Okay, I've forwarded your request to our education team. They should reach out soon to help you further.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, brilliant. I appreciate your help, [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nHi again, this is [NAME] from MusicBird, can you hear me alright?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, hi [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nGreat. So, I heard about your interest in MusicBird for educational purposes. Can I confirm your email address to offer you a complimentary educator\u2019s account to explore our full content?\n\nCustomer:\nThat would be fantastic, yes, please use this email address. And don't worry about any delays, I understand things are hectic right now.\n\nAgent:\nPerfect, I've taken note of that. Someone from our team will be setting this up for you shortly.\n\nCustomer:\nI really appreciate this, [NAME]. I'm excited to show it to my colleagues as well.\n\nAgent:\nHello, this is [NAME] from the Education team at MusicBird. How are things on your end?\n\nCustomer:\nHi [NAME], all good here, just quite busy with assessments.\n\nAgent:\nUnderstandable. I wanted to help set up your educational account but it seems I don't have the right email registered. Did you create an account with us yet?\n\nCustomer:\nAh, actually, no. I used a personal account before. I'll set up a new one right now.\n\nAgent:\nYeah, go ahead with that and let me know once it\u2019s done, so I can unlock everything for you. I can also share a video link and some lesson recommendations if you'd like.\n\nCustomer:\nAccount's all set up. I can't wait to show my team the full capability of MusicBird, so thank you for this assistance, [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nThat's great to hear, [NAME]. I'll get that promotion applied to your new account as soon as possible. Enjoy showcasing MusicBird to your colleagues, and good luck with the assessments!\n\nCustomer:\nThank you so much, you've been incredibly helpful. Have a great day.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, this is [NAME] from MusicBird customer support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi [NAME], I've got a bit of a situation here. My 2-month subscription is about to end, and I'm wondering if I could continue on the same terms I have now. I'm from [ADDRESS] and with the currency rate, it's quite tough at the moment.\n\nAgent:\nI understand, these are challenging times indeed. Let me check your account details for a moment.\n\nCustomer:\nSure, thank you. I've been really happy with the app, but yeah, it's just a bit difficult right now, financially speaking.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, [NAME]. Okay, I have some good news for you. I've added another 30% off coupon to your account for the next two months.\n\nCustomer:\nReally? That's fantastic, thank you!\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! This means your subscription will continue at the discounted rate for April and May. If you need anything else, just let me know.\n\nCustomer:\nThx, just to clarify, you mean it will be discounted until about June 21st, right?\n\nAgent:\nYes, exactly. Your next billing will be on the 24th of April for USD 13.99, and the same on the 24th of May. Does that work for you?\n\nCustomer:\nActually, [NAME], I'm currently not in a position to renew my subscription. Could I cancel it but possibly come back later without losing my progress?\n\nAgent:\nOh, I see, no problem at all. I wanted to ask if there were any technical issues or feedback you'd like to share with us before I go ahead and cancel it?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, no issues. It's all been great, just the financial part is tricky. So, please cancel it and make sure it doesn't renew on the 23rd.\n\nAgent:\nUnderstood, [NAME]. I have canceled your subscription, so there won't be any renewal on the 23rd of June. And don't worry, should you decide to come back, your progress will be waiting for you.\n\nCustomer:\nThat's a relief to hear. Thank you so much for understanding. Have a good day!",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for calling MusicBird support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, hi, I got an email saying my subscription payment is overdue, and you're going to cancel my account. Right now, I can't afford it, so can you just cancel it for me?\n\nAgent:\nOh, I see. I can definitely help you with that. Let's make sure no further payments are attempted. I've just gone ahead and canceled the subscription, and I've also cleared the balance owing on your account.\n\nCustomer:\nThat's great, thanks. By the way, I might consider coming back to MusicBird later on. Is there any discount for returning customers?\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, [NAME]. We'd love to have you back. When you decide to return, we can certainly offer you a loyalty discount. Would you like to get that set up now?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I want to come back, and I remember you mentioned a loyalty discount. So, what kind of offer can you make me?\n\nAgent:\nWelcome back! It\u2019s wonderful to hear you\u2019re ready to jump back into practice. How about a 20% discount to get you started? You can choose between an annual or monthly plan. Just let me know which you'd prefer, and I\u2019ll take care of it.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks, [NAME]. Let's start with a monthly plan for now. Maybe I\u2019ll switch to annual later. Can you give me the discount code or how does this work?\n\nAgent:\nOf course! You don\u2019t need a code. I will set up the discount from our side and reactivate your account on a discounted monthly plan. Are you ready to go ahead with this now?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, please go ahead and proceed. Thank you.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, I\u2019m on it. One moment please. Okay, [NAME], you are now subscribed to the monthly plan with your 20% discount in place. Enjoy your music practice, and welcome back!\n\nCustomer:\nWait, just to clarify, I don't need to subscribe myself again online, do I? Or do I get a code first?\n\nAgent:\nNo, you don't need to do anything more. Everything has been taken care of on my end. You're all subscribed with the discount applied.\n\nCustomer:\nGreat, but what if the payment isn't going through? I think my card should work.\n\nAgent:\nLet me check that for you. It seems there was an issue with the payment due to insufficient funds. Could you please update your payment information, and then let me know? I can then reactivate your subscription with the discount.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, okay. I updated my payment info on MusicBird. Could you check if the discount can be applied now?",
    "Agent:\nHello, thank you for contacting customer support. How may I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, so I've got an issue with the practice time in the app. If I start practicing at, like, 11:50 PM and finish at 12:10 AM, the app doesn't split the time between the two days.\n\nAgent:\nI see. And is there anything else?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, there's another thing. The lowest 'C' note isn't highlighting when I'm supposed to see the finger positions. It's kinda inconsistent, happens only under certain scenarios.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, thank you for bringing that to our attention. Regarding the practice time, I understand how you'd want it to count for both days. Currently, the time is applied to the day you end your practice, which I know isn't ideal for your situation. Sadly, that's how the app is designed at the moment, but I'll definitely forward your feedback to our team.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, that's unfortunate. But, uh, about the missing note highlights?\n\nAgent:\nYes, that seems to be a known bug. We're working on fixing that. Could you tell me which lessons you're encountering this issue with?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's kinda random, but I'll make sure to take note next time it happens.\n\nAgent:\nPlease do, that would be really helpful. Anything else you need assistance with?\n\nCustomer:\nActually, yeah. I've been enjoying your app a lot and I'd like to offer my help. I'm a software engineer and I'd be keen on testing the app or even working on it. I'm not looking for any compensation.\n\nAgent:\nWow, that's really generous of you! Currently, we're not looking for testers, but I'll keep your contact and let you know if something comes up in the future. Could you also tell me a bit more about your availability and background?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I'm usually free in the evenings. I work at this place called Nextep during the day. And yeah, I use MusicBird every day, I've got a bunch of MIDI controllers, and I'm even set up for guitar MIDI if you guys ever head in that direction.\n\nAgent:\nThat's great to hear! We don\u2019t offer guitar lessons yet but it\u2019s definitely something we're considering for the future. I'll make a note of your details and your equipment.\n\nCustomer:\nAwesome, I really appreciate it. Thanks!\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! If you ever encounter any more issues or have suggestions, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!",
    "Agent:\nHi, thank you for calling customer support. My name is [NAME]. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I've been having trouble for the past couple of days. I can't access or view any \"Lessons\" or \"Favorites\" in my app.\n\nAgent:\nI see, and what error message are you getting when you try to access these sections?\n\nCustomer:\nIt says, \"No lessons match your filter,\" but I'm not using any filters.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, can you tell me if you have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, or checked your network settings for any VPNs or firewalls?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I tried both uninstalling and reinstalling, and I've checked my network settings. There's nothing out of the ordinary there.\n\nAgent:\nHmm, and if I may ask, has anybody else tried using their account on your device? Just to check if the issue is account-specific.\n\nCustomer:\nActually, yes. I logged in with my wife's account, and all the lessons were visible there.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, well it might be something with the local data then. Have you tried clearing all local data from the app?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I haven't done that. How do I go about it?\n\nAgent:\nWell, I can send you a file to run that will clear it for you. You won't lose any progress, but you might have to remap any custom controller settings afterward.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, could you send that over? I'd like to give it a try.\n\nAgent:\nCertainly. Just make sure the app is completely closed before you run it. I'll stay on the line while you do that.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, give me a moment. Okay, it looks like that solved the problem! Thank you so much.\n\nAgent:\nThat's excellent news! Now, regarding the inconvenience, how about a 30% discount on your first year's subscription if you upgrade to an annual plan?\n\nCustomer:\nReally? That would be fantastic! My wife is also using the app, can we get a discount for her too?\n\nAgent:\nSure thing! Can I get the email for her account?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's [EMAIL_ADDRESS].\n\nAgent:\nGreat, I've got that. I\u2019ll generate the promo code for your annual subscription. You'll both get 30% off your first year.\n\nCustomer:\nI really appreciate it, [NAME]. That\u2019s incredibly generous of you!\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! Just enter the code MusicBird-IUYG984A when you upgrade. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with.\n\nCustomer:\nCodes were used, and they worked perfectly. Again, thank you. You've been a huge help.\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely no problem, I'm glad I could help. Enjoy your practice, and feel free to reach out if you ever need assistance again.\n\nCustomer:\nBy the way, I recommended MusicBird to a friend, and he's looking to sign up for an annual membership too. Can we get a code for him?\n\nAgent:\nDefinitely, tell him to set up his account and get in touch with us. We'd be happy to arrange that for him.\n\nCustomer:\nAmazing, I copied him on this email, so he'll take it from here. Thanks for the excellent service!",
    "Agent:\nHi there, welcome to our customer support. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'd like to get a refund. The app isn't working on my iPad and it keeps freezing.\n\nAgent:\nOh no, that's not good. Have you tried any troubleshooting steps?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I've tried multiple fixes already but nothing works. Can I have a refund, please?\n\nAgent:\nI understand. Sorry to hear you've had such trouble. Could you tell me which iPad model you're using?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, it's the new 4th gen iPad Pro 12.9 inch.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, thank you. And how are you connecting your keyboard to the iPad?\n\nCustomer:\nI'm using an m-audio key station 49es, connected via USB right to the iPad.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, I see. Well, I'm really sorry you've been experiencing issues. We are about to release an app update which might resolve these problems. To make up for the inconvenience.\n\nCustomer:\nBut I still want a refund.\n\nAgent:\nOf course, I've already processed your refund, so please allow a few days for the transaction to complete. Additionally, we\u2019d like to offer you a free month on the app before the update. This might help with your setup.\n\nCustomer:\nOk thanks, I appreciate that.\n\nAgent:\nNo problem. In the meantime, could you take a look at our iPad connection guide to see if it helps?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I can do that.\n\nAgent:\nGreat, thanks. And after your free month, we\u2019d love to hear back if the app update has improved your experience.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, will do. Thanks for the help!",
    "Agent:\nHello, thank you for calling our customer support. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHey, I have a question about payment, please. I would like to know when my annual subscription expires in May and if it is possible to get a little discount. I can't connect so much, but I'd hate to stop. Sorry for my English.\n\nAgent:\nHi [NAME], I see. Let me check your account details for the expiry date. Just a moment, please.\n\nCustomer:\nSure, thanks.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, [NAME], your next billing date is June 8th, not May. And about the discount, we can definitely talk about that towards the end of next month as our offers might change by then.\n\nCustomer:\nTHANKS, CIAO.\n\nCustomer:\nHello again, considering my subscription expires on June 8th, I might not have much time to practice because of work, but I'd like to remain a subscriber. Could you make me a proposal for a year or for each month. so I can load my card and pay before it expires?\n\nAgent:\nHi [NAME], I understand you're looking to renew. Let me see what I can do for you. One moment, please.\n\nAgent:\nWhat discount can we offer for current subscribers?\n\nAgent:\nHey there, [NAME]. Thanks for waiting. I've got good news for you. I've managed to apply a coupon to your account for $25 off your renewal. I'm sending you the invoice for your reference. Do you have any other questions or need further assistance?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's fantastic, thank you!\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome, [NAME]. Have a great day. If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call.\n\nCustomer:\nCiao and thanks for your patience.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for calling customer support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, well, I'm having trouble with MusicBird. After installing it, it wouldn't read my TD17kvx vdums. I tried reinstalling the app, but now it just won't open, it keeps crashing. I'm on a 2015 Macbook Pro, OS 11.2.3.\n\nAgent:\nOh, I see. That's quite frustrating. Let's try clearing out all the local data to see if that helps. Have you made sure MusicBird is completely closed before we proceed?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, the app isn't running now.\n\nAgent:\nGreat. What I'll need you to do next is download and run a file I\u2019ll provide. It\u2019ll clear data but won\u2019t affect your progress. Although, if you've made any custom controller mappings, you\u2019ll need to set those up again. Is that going to be alright?\n\nCustomer:\nI've got no mappings, so that should be fine. And thanks, by the way.\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! Let me know how it goes after you've run the file. Also, just a heads up, when you restart MusicBird, it might take a little longer to start lessons as it redownloads everything.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, will do. Also, I had another question: if I buy an annual subscription, can I use it for both keyboard and drums?\n\nAgent:\nYes, absolutely. One annual subscription covers all instruments in MusicBird.\n\nCustomer:\nGreat to hear. Give me a second, I'll run the file and let you know.\n\nCustomer:\nSo, I\u2019ve reinstalled the app, but it's still not responding\u2014it's the same issue.\n\nAgent:\nHmm, that's troublesome. We'll need to dig deeper then. Could you send me some log files from a specific folder? I\u2019ll give you the path to follow.\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I'll check.\n\nCustomer:\nI've looked, and there's no MusicBird folder in the application support folder. I can't find the logs.\n\nAgent:\nAh, okay, let's try another way to find that folder. There's a setting to make the Library folder visible. Once you do that, you should be able to see the MusicBird logs path.\n\nCustomer:\nI\u2019m on Big Sur OS and I can't seem to find the option to show the Library folder.\n\nAgent:\nGotcha. Try this: open your user folder, tap Command plus J, and it should show you the option.\n\nCustomer:\nLet me see. Yep, found it, and I've sent the zipped log files to you.\n\nAgent:\nPerfect, I've got the files. I'm forwarding this to our developers now. We'll get to the bottom of this. Thanks for your patience!\n\nCustomer:\nNo problem, appreciate the help.\n\nCustomer:\nHello, any update on the issue?",
    "Agent:\nHi there, welcome to MusicBird Support. My name's [NAME]. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHey [NAME], I'd like to cancel my subscription. I just don't feel like I need it anymore.\n\nAgent:\nSure, I can help you with that. Really glad to hear you had a good experience with us. Can I just confirm your account details?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, it's [NAME]. I've been with you guys for around 6 years, and it's really improved my playing.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, got it, [NAME]. Six years is quite a journey! Thank you for sticking with us for so long. Before we proceed, would you be interested in sharing more about your MusicBird journey?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I'd love to. What's the best way for me to do that?\n\nAgent:\nGreat! Let me just check with my team on how we can arrange that and I'll get back to you soon. Is that okay for you?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, that sounds good. Looking forward to it.\n\nAgent:\nAwesome, I\u2019ll be in touch shortly. And [NAME], a big thank you once again for all your support!\n\nCustomer:\nSure thing, just keep me posted.\n\nAgent:\nWill do, [NAME]! Have a great day ahead. Goodbye for now.",
    "Agent:\nHi [NAME], thanks for reaching out to our support center. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, hi. I've got an issue with the Basslines app. It's asking me to play a Bb on the second square in exercise 2 of the Building Basslines exercise, but my keyboard doesn't have that key. The lowest key I have is a C above that Bb. I tried mapping my Casio keyboard in the app settings, but it didn't resolve the problem.\n\nAgent:\nI see. Have you tried using the octave up or down buttons on your keyboard, or maybe a transpose function to get into the right note range? There might be a way to adjust it that's covered in your user manual.\n\nCustomer:\nNo, my keyboard doesn't have that feature to change octaves. Shouldn't the app take into account the keys I have when I map it? Why am I seeing lessons that have notes I can't play?\n\nAgent:\nI understand your concern, [NAME]. It seems like your particular Casio model doesn't support the octave shift function. Sadly, we haven\u2019t incorporated a feature in our software to deal with this just yet. Generally, most of the lessons should work with a 61-key keyboard, but I'll make sure to pass your feedback on to the team for future improvements.\n\nCustomer:\nSo, what now? I still can't play this lesson.\n\nAgent:\nWell, one possible solution is to use additional software, something like a MIDI routing program. We've helped other customers in similar situations using a software called Midipipe on Mac systems. It allows custom mapping which might solve your problem. If you're up for it, I'd be happy to walk you through the setup process and create a custom mapping for you. It may take a little time, though.\n\nCustomer:\nThat sounds complicated. I was hoping for a quick fix.",
    "Agent:\nHello and welcome to MusicBird customer service, my name is [NAME]. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHey, [NAME]. Just a quick bit of feedback: I love the app's design and gamification, but I don't feel like I've learned to actually play music.\n\nAgent:\nI see, thanks for your feedback, [NAME]. Could you tell me a bit more about what you were expecting from MusicBird?\n\nCustomer:\nOf course. So, I was a total newbie to piano. Loved the electronic music focus and the iPad app worked well, but I noticed sync issues between my iPad and Mac. Also, there's too much emphasis on playing perfectly in time for a beginner like me.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, got it. We actually updated our iPad app recently, but you should close the app completely to sync your progress. Now about the precision focus, I understand it can feel a bit robotic. We're always looking for ways to improve though.\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I tried another app, Skoove, not as snazzy but it let me play melodies right away. And I got into playing by myself more. Also, the pads exercises didn't really help with finger drumming like I hoped.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I've noted your feedback on the pads and the focus on melodies. We appreciate the insights this gives us.\n\nCustomer:\nAnd one more thing, losing streaks because you miss one day is super frustrating. Maybe add a streak freeze feature?\n\nAgent:\nA streak freeze, that's an interesting idea. I'll definitely pass that suggestion along. If you ever think of coming back to MusicBird, we'd love to have you.\n\nCustomer:\nActually, I picked up an Ableton Push 2 and it got me curious about MusicBird again. Is that loyalty discount still on the table?\n\nAgent:\nThat's great to hear, [NAME]! Yep, we can offer you a 30% discount on the annual subscription. Here\u2019s a promo code for you: MusicBird-YGSD151A.\n\nCustomer:\nWow, that's generous, thank you!\n\nAgent:\nNo problem at all! Enjoy making music, and let us know if there\u2019s anything else we can do for you. Have a great day!\n\nCustomer:\nDefinitely will, thanks again!",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for contacting our support line. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHello. I need help with my son's iPad. There's a problem since the new update.\n\nAgent:\nI see. Could you tell me more about the issue you're experiencing?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, so there's this huge delay whenever he taps the screen, like a 7 to 10-second wait. It only started after the update.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. And which model of the iPad is he using?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's the 2016 iPad Pro, the 9.7-inch model.\n\nAgent:\nAll right. Let me see what we can do about that. And by the way, we really appreciate your support for our company!\n\nCustomer:\nOh, thank you. I just want to clarify, it's not just latency. The whole app is slow.\n\nAgent:\nUnderstood. Just to narrow down the problem, have you checked if this happens on a faster network?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, everything is on wired connections, so it's not a network thing. My own iPad, the 2019 model, runs the app perfectly.\n\nAgent:\nInteresting. How much storage is left on your son's iPad? Sometimes that can impact performance.\n\nCustomer:\nThere's about 100GB free. Do you think the processor is too old for the new app?\n\nAgent:\nHmm, you know, we're at the moment looking into some performance issues with certain iPad models. I apologize for the inconvenience this is causing.\n\nAgent:\nWould you mind trying to delete the app and reinstalling it? Sometimes that helps.\n\nCustomer:\nHi there, I tried reinstalling already. No change, unfortunately. So, we upgraded to a 2019 iPad Pro. The app is fine now, but there's a new issue. We can't get any audio output to work with the V Drums.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, that's a bit tricky. I'm honestly not entirely sure if V Drums can function as an audio output. That's more a question for [NAME].\n\nCustomer:\nAh, I see.",
    "Agent:\nHello, and thank you for calling MusicBird support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHola, I was thinking. I'd like to try out the complete plan before I decide on an annual subscription, but I don't want to pay so much for just one month. Is there, like, a free trial month available or something?\n\nAgent:\nSure, I understand you want to try it out first. What we can do is, when you sign back in, I'll set you up with a week's free trial so you can explore MusicBird and see if it fits what you're looking for.\n\nCustomer:\nWow, thank you so much!\n\nAgent:\nNot a problem at all. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\nCustomer:\nHola [NAME], how's everything? I'm actually considering coming back to MusicBird, I really enjoyed my time with the service. Are there any current discounts for the annual plan?\n\nAgent:\nYeah, hi! Thanks for reaching back out to us. I see here that your subscription is still active actually, and you did receive a $25 discount on your last payment. You can log in any time and pick up right where you left off.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, muchas gracias! I must have gotten the dates mixed up, haha. Take care!",
    "Agent:\nGood afternoon, thank you for calling MusicBird Support. My name's [NAME]. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there, I'm [NAME]. I've got a problem with my subscription payments I need help with.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, [NAME], I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can you tell me what the issue is with your payments?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, so I noticed I was charged twice this month and I'm not sure why that happened. I need to sort it out.\n\nAgent:\nI see, double charged. That's certainly something we want to address. Can I get the email associated with your MusicBird account to check the details?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, it's [EMAIL_ADDRESS]\n\nAgent:\nThanks, [NAME]. Give me just a moment, I'm checking your account now.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I found your subscription. Uh-huh, it does look like there was an extra charge this month. I apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, it's a bit frustrating to be honest. Can you fix it?\n\nAgent:\nI can definitely help with that. What I'll do is process a refund for the extra charge. It should reflect within 5 to 10 business days.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, that sounds good. And can you make sure this doesn't happen again?\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, I'll also put a note in your account and monitor it on the next billing cycle to ensure the charge is correct.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, I appreciate that. Thanks for your help.\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome, [NAME]. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that should do it. Just make sure the refund comes through, okay?\n\nAgent:\nYes, of course, you'll receive an email confirmation of the refund soon. If there's anything else, don't hesitate to contact us. Have a great day!\n\nCustomer:\nWill do. Bye.",
    "Agent:\nHello, welcome to MusicBird support! How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm trying to get access to the Chord Library.\n\nAgent:\nSure! I can help with that. I'm sending you the file link to the Chord Library right now. There are 62 MIDI Templates. Just make sure to download it on your desktop and drag the MIDI files into your production software.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, got it.\n\nAgent:\nHere's the file link coming up.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks!\n\nAgent:\nNo problem! By the way, are you interested in learning to play the keyboard as a music producer?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I'm interested.\n\nAgent:\nAwesome! We've got a new piece of software designed to teach music producers how to play the keyboard quickly and easily. Would you like early access?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, that sounds great!\n\nAgent:\nFantastic! It's not quite ready, but we'll be sure to contact you with more details soon.\n\nCustomer:\nSounds good, I'll wait for your update.\n\nAgent:\nHey, just wanted to let you know MusicBird Keys is launching soon. Our CEO Sam has made an update video about the release and what's included in the app. You should check it out!\n\nCustomer:\nOh, interesting. What can I get with the free plan, though?\n\nAgent:\nWith our free plan, you will get up to 5 minutes of practice time per day and access to 60 lessons, including the Pads, Keys, and Drums. Each category has 20 lessons. If you want more, subscribers get additional benefits. I can give you more information on that if you're interested.\n\nCustomer:\nYes, please send me more info.\n\nAgent:\nYou got it. I'll send you all the details right now. And if you have any more questions, I'm here to help!\n\nCustomer:\nGreat, thank you!",
    "Agent:\nHello, this is MusicBird customer support. How may I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHey, I was really excited to use the special discount you guys advertised, but it's not applying the 50% off it mentioned. I need some assistance because I don't want to miss out on this deal.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, I'm here to help with that. Can you tell me the email address linked to your MusicBird account?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, my email address is [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. And just so you know, I don't have an active subscription right now.\n\nAgent:\nOk, I see. Did you manage to receive any emails about the sale we are currently running?\n\nCustomer:\nI got one, but it's showing 30% off, not the 50% I was expecting. And I want to sort this out 'cause I'm considering re-subscribing after a tough year.\n\nCustomer:\nHello?\n\nAgent:\nMy apologies for the wait. Let me just clarify, the offer you saw for 50% off, was it something you discussed in an email previously?\n\nCustomer:\nExactly, I had a conversation with [NAME] about it. I'm really looking for that 50% discount.\n\nAgent:\nI see. Let me check on that for you. Oh and by the way, can you also tell me the name you need for your Visa and bank records?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, but I'd really appreciate it if we could get this discount thing sorted out first.\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, understand. Let me take a moment to review your account details and previous correspondence. And, could you tell me more about the payment name issue, so I can assist you better?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, I'm trying to find what I previously paid for a full year's subscription on my bank statements, but I can't find your company's name on them.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. I will look up the details on our end for your previous payments. Meanwhile, can I interest you in our current promotion of 30% off, which might actually be more beneficial?\n\nCustomer:\nBut my main concern is that after I paid for an entire year before and didn't get to use it, a 30% discount off the new price doesn't seem like the deal we had discussed.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, I understand where you're coming from. I'll see what I can do regarding the discount promised. Give me a moment.\n\nCustomer:\nAnd there's been no email about updating my payment details as mentioned before.\n\nAgent:\nPlease bear with me while I check our records and the previous commitment we made to you. I'm going to try and honor that.\n\nCustomer:\nThat's all I'm asking. If you could just respect the agreement we had, that would make things right.\n\nAgent:\n[NAME], thank you for your patience. I've gone over the emails and considering your situation, I'd like to offer you a 30% discount on the old rate for your first year of re-subscription as a welcome back gesture. Would that be acceptable to you?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, that sounds good. Let's do that.\n\nAgent:\nOk, I'll need you to update your payment details. I'm sending you another email now. Please follow the instructions so we can proceed.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, all set here.\n\nAgent:\nFantastic, I'm processing this now and your subscription should be all active again shortly. And the amount for the renewed subscription is now $83.88.\n\nCustomer:\nThank you so much! Just to confirm, my subscription is active now, and the payment has been taken care of?\n\nAgent:\nYes, everything looks good on our end. Can you log in with your email and password to access your MusicBird account and make sure it's working for you?\n\nCustomer:\nYep, I can see my plan here.

    "Agent:\nHi [NAME], thanks for contacting us. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nYesterday I decided to buy Mwlodics for the whole year, but today I saw that you have a discount for it, and there was no information in the app. I feel it's a bit unfair.\n\nAgent:\nOh, I see. That does sound frustrating.\n\nCustomer:\nCan I cancel it and buy again with the discount that you offer? It's only been 24 hours since the purchase.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, definitely. We'll be happy to honour our sale price for you since you just subscribed.

Anything else I can help you with today?\n\nCustomer:\nJust one thing. Is MusicBird for Keys a different payment from Pads, or can I switch from Pads to Keys in the app?\n\nAgent:\nYou can just switch within the app. Your MusicBird subscription covers all instruments \u2013 Keys, Pads, and Drums.\n\nCustomer:\nI love you guys! Thanks a lot!\n\nAgent:\nNo worries at all. Happy practicing! And don't forget to tag us in your videos.\n\nCustomer:\nI will, thanks again!\n\nAgent:\nLooking forward to it! Have a great day, [NAME].\n\nCustomer:\nHi again. My PayPal informed me about a payment for you guys, and I wasn't aware of that. Could you please cancel my subscription and refund the money? Invoice number 83631348.\n\nAgent:\nSure, could you also provide the PayPal transaction number?\n\nAgent:\nGot it. I\u2019ll forward this to our team and we will process your refund as soon as possible.\n\nCustomer:\n[NAME], you are so good at customer service. Big up!",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for reaching out to MusicBird support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm considering using MusicBird for my students at school. We're a small school and would like to share one subscription. We use JAMF and Apple School Manager to deploy apps on managed iPads. Can we set it up like that?\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm. Let me check on that for you. Please hold on a moment.\n\nCustomer:\nSure, thank you.\n\nAgent:\nI'm sorry about the wait. Okay, so what I've found is that although we haven't done anything specific to integrate with JAMF or Apple School Manager, there shouldn't be any issues using them with MusicBird. What I can offer you is a free month to try everything out and see how it goes. Does that sound good?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, that would be great!\n\nAgent:\nFantastic. So, to get started, sign up for a free account, and then just send me back the email address you've registered with. I'll get that month unlocked for you. And once you've tried it, we can talk about educational discounts for either an annual or term-by-term subscription. How does that all sound?\n\nCustomer:\nThat sounds perfect. I'll get that account set up and email you the details.\n\nAgent:\nBrilliant. Once I receive your email, I'll take care of the rest. And if you have any questions along the way, feel free to reach out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's everything.

So, I was told by [NAME] and [NAME] from the Melbourne Ableton group that we could get some free access. I started exploring it today and I'm really enjoying it.\n\nAgent:\nOh great, you're part of the [NAME] group. I see, you're looking for that free access deal, right?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, exactly. They mentioned free access for the group members, and I'm just getting into it.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, let me check your account details quickly. Hmm, alright.

And remember, if you have any questions or run into any issues, just give us a call.\n\nCustomer:\nWill do. I really appreciate your help today, [NAME]. Thank you!\n\nAgent:\nNo problem at all, [NAME]. Thank you for your enthusiasm, and have a great day!",
    "Agent:\nGood evening, this is [NAME] from customer support. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHey [NAME], good to talk to you. I've got a couple of things. First off, I just want to say thanks for the annual discount code, that's really awesome. And, um, do you guys have an affiliate program or anything like that?\n\nAgent:\nYeah, of course, I'm glad you're pleased with the discount code. As for the affiliate program, we're definitely looking into that. Could you tell me a bit more about your community?\n\nCustomer:\nYep, I've got a pretty engaged community that I reckon would love your product. So, if there's some kind of incentive, I'm sure I could get them on board.\n\nAgent:\nSounds good, I see. Could you send through some details about your community? I'll pass it on to the team and we'll take a look at it.\n\nCustomer:\nSure thing, will do. Oh, and also, I've been having trouble with the app. I forgot my password, and the reset email isn't coming through. I've tried all my email addresses.\n\nAgent:\nI'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues with logging in. Let me just check on that for you. Oh, it looks like there was a typo in your email on our end. My apologies for that.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, really?\n\nAgent:\nYes, I've corrected it just now. Could you please try logging in again and see if that works?\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, give me a second. Hey, it looks like it's working now. That's a relief.\n\nAgent:\nFantastic! I'm glad to hear that solved the problem. Is there anything else I can assist you with tonight?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's everything. Thanks a lot, [NAME]. You've been a great help.\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great evening!",
    "Agent:\nGood morning! Thank you for contacting MusicBird support, how may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHey there, I'm just wondering if there's any info on an upcoming sale or something?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there! I was wondering if there's any information about an upcoming sale?\n\nAgent:\nHi [NAME], I appreciate you reaching out to us. Unfortunately, I don't have any details on future sales at the moment. We typically announce those closer to the date. The best way to stay informed is to keep an eye on our email newsletters and social media channels.\n\nAgent:\nHey Lvurent, thank you for reaching out. Currently, I don't have any details about future sales. We tend to plan them quite close to the date. I'd suggest keeping an eye on our email newsletters or social media updates for any sale announcements!\n\nCustomer:\nOh, hello again. Looks like there's a sale going on right now, and I plan to hop on the deals!\n\nCustomer:\nOh, alright, I understand. Oh, hang on, looks like you guys have a sale going on right now and I'm going to jump on it!\n\nAgent:\nThat's great to hear, Lvurent! Glad you found the sale. Yes, we do have some awesome deals happening right now. Is there anything in particular you're looking to grab?\n\nAgent:\nYes, Lvurent, that's correct, we have a sale at the moment. If you need assistance or recommendations, I'm right here to help you.\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, so here's my question. I'm searching for a drum pad, not a full drum set you know, just a pad that has several pads on it for drumming lessons. Makes sense? I need some advice on picking one that's fully compatible.\n\nCustomer:\nFantastic! So, I'm actually looking for a drum pad. You know, not for finger drumming but rather for practicing drumming lessons, but it's not a full set. I need just a pad with several zones. Does that make sense? Could you help me find something compatible?\n\nAgent:\nSure, I believe I understand what you're looking for. We do have a variety of drum pads that could suit your needs. I'll need to check on their compatibility with your lessons. Could you tell me a bit more about the equipment or software you'll be using with it?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I'll be using it mostly with my computer, and I might hook it up to other stuff later, but I want it to work with drum lesson software primarily.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, thanks for the info. Let me quickly check our catalog for products that would be a perfect match for you. Please bear with me for a moment.\n\n[Pause as the agent checks the information]\n\nAgent:\nI've found a couple of options that would work well with your computer and drumming software. The first one is the BeatMaster 8-pad drum pad. It's quite versatile and has good sensitivity for different drumming styles. The second is the RhythmPro Compact, which has a smaller footprint but allows for dynamic playing. Both are compatible with most drum software.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, that sounds good. Could you tell me a bit more about the BeatMaster?\n\nAgent:\nCertainly. The BeatMaster 8-pad features eight velocity-sensitive pads and comes with built-in drum sounds, but you can also load your own samples. It connects via USB and is fully MIDI compliant, so it will work seamlessly with your drumming software.\n\nCustomer:\nI like the sound of that! And the price is okay with the sale, right?\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, the sale applies to both options, so you'd be getting a great deal either way.\n\nCustomer:\nPerfect! I think I'll go with the BeatMaster then. Can I place the order through you or should I do it online?\n\nAgent:\nYou can place the order directly with me over the phone, and I'll make sure it's processed immediately.\n\nCustomer:\nThat's great, let's do that then. Thank you so much for your help!\n\nAgent:\nYou're very welcome, Lvurent! I'll take down your details and we'll get that order sorted for you right away. And just to confirm, you're going for the BeatMaster 8-pad, is that correct?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, that's the one.\n\nAgent:\nPerfect. Can I have your shipping information, please? \n\n[The agent proceeds with the order process]\n\nAgent:\nAlright, Lvurent, your order is all set! You'll get an email confirmation shortly. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's everything. You've been a great help, thank you!\n\nAgent:\nIt's been my pleasure. Enjoy your new drum pad, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions. Have a great day!\n\nCustomer:\nYou too, bye!",
    "Agent:\nHello, welcome to MusicBird Support! This is [NAME] speaking. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHouse music.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, are you looking for house music tracks or playlists?\n\nCustomer:\nHouse music.\n\nAgent:\nYes, I understand you're interested in house music. How can I help with that specifically?\n\nCustomer:\nYes.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, have you tried checking our FAQs for information on how to find house music on our platform?\n\nCustomer:\nNo.\n\nAgent:\nNo problem. I can guide you through the process. What exactly are you struggling with? Are you unable to find a specific artist or album?\n\nCustomer:\nYes.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. Could you please tell me the name of the artist or the album you're looking for?\n\nCustomer:\n[NAME].\n\nAgent:\nAh, I see. Just a moment while I look that up for you. Thanks for your patience.\n\nAgent:\nSorry, could you repeat that? I had trouble hearing you clearly.\n\nCustomer:\n[NAME].\n\nAgent:\nGot it. I'm looking into it now. It seems like we're having a bit of a connection issue, but I'll do my best to help.\n\nAgent:\nI'm sorry to say I can't find \"[NAME]\" in our database. Could it be under a different name, or is there a specific track you're looking for?\n\nCustomer:\nThat's what I was told. \"[NAME].\"\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, I understand this can be frustrating. Let me double-check for any related artists or alternative spellings. One moment.\n\nAgent:\nMy apologies, but it appears we do not have \"[NAME]\" or similar in our library. We can definitely take note and look into adding it in the future. Would you like me to submit a request for this artist?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, please, that would be great.\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, I'll get that request submitted right away for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's all. Thank you.",
    "Agent:\nHi there, welcome to MusicBird support. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHello, I wanted to grab that Chord Library you guys offer with all the MIDI templates.\n\nAgent:\nSure, I can help you with that. Have you clicked the \"Give me the library\" button in the ad you saw?\n\nCustomer:\nWait, what was that? Sorry, my connection's a bit bad.\n\nAgent:\nNo worries. To get the MIDI, just click the \"Give me the library\" button below the ad you've seen. Have you found it?\n\nCustomer:\nOh, okay. Do you mean on the website? Yeah, I see it now.\n\nAgent:\nYep, that's the one. You'll want to download the file to your desktop computer, and then you can drag and drop the MIDI templates into your production software.\n\nCustomer:\nGot it, I'm doing that now.\n\nAgent:\nAwesome. By the way, are you also interested in learning to play the keyboard as a music producer?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, absolutely.\n\nAgent:\nWe have a brand-new software specifically designed to help music producers like you quickly learn to play the keyboard. Would you like to try it?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, how do I start?\n\nAgent:\nGreat! You can start with a free trial. Just click the link below. Would you need me to send it to you?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, please, that'd be great.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, done. The link should be in your inbox. Now, I see that [NAME] replied to an ad. Is there anything else you need assistance with today?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, no, that's all for now, thank you.\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! If you have any more questions or if you need support, don't hesitate to contact us at our support email for a fast reply. And just so you know, we're based in [ADDRESS], so there might be a slight delay depending on your time zone.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, thanks for the heads up. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nAgent:\nNo problem at all. MusicBird typically replies within a few hours. Enjoy your new chord library and software trial, and have a great day!\n\nCustomer:\nYou too, thanks for all the help!\n\nAgent:\nIt's my pleasure. Take care! Goodbye.",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for calling MusicBird support. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm having a problem with MusicBird. It's stuttering on my computer but it's a pretty powerful machine, so I don't think that should be happening.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, I understand how that could be frustrating. Could you tell me more about when this stuttering happens? Also, could you confirm your computer's specs for me?\n\nCustomer:\nSure. It's mostly when I'm playing, like, multiple notes at the same time. I'm using an i7-9700k with a GTX 1060 and 32 GB of RAM.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. Have you checked if V-Sync is enabled, and does this issue occur in all lessons or just specific ones?\n\nCustomer:\nIt doesn't seem to matter which lesson, it's just inconsistent. I have both G-Sync and V-Sync available. Closing other programs doesn't help. I've tried restarting, too.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, let's troubleshoot a bit. Have you tried running MusicBird with integrated graphics instead of your GTX 1060?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I haven't tried that.\n\nAgent:\nRight, so what you can do is try changing that in the NVIDIA Control Panel. Let me guide you through the steps. Can you check if that works out for you?\n\nCustomer:\nI followed the steps but there's no option for using integrated graphics. No improvement with other settings adjustments either.\n\nAgent:\nHmm, that's odd. You may want to clear your local data. It's safe, I assure you, although you might face a short delay when you restart MusicBird as it re-downloads content.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, I'll try that. Also, I noticed there's an option for Compatibility Mode. Should I give that a go as well?\n\nAgent:\nYes, running MusicBird in Compatibility Mode might help. Try it with Windows 8 setting and let me know if that makes any difference.\n\nCustomer:\nIt didn't work. Also, the issues seem to only occur when I'm actually playing notes.\n\nAgent:\nThat's troubling to hear. Let's delve a little deeper. Can you tell me about your audio and MIDI setup? Are all your drivers up to date?\n\nCustomer:\nI use the Maschine MK2 through USB and the Steinberg UR44. As for the drivers, I reinstalled the Maschine drivers just now to be sure.\n\nCustomer:\nAny updates? Tried different interfaces and direct USB connections and I'm still stuck with that stuttering problem.\n\nAgent:\nI apologize for the trouble. We're still working on app optimization. In the meantime, have you tried using another audio device or ASIO4ALL drivers to see if that resolves the issue?\n\nCustomer:\nNo luck there. Gave up on the controller, too. There's stuttering even when using keys, however, the MIDI doesn't get recognized unless I use USB, which isn't my usual setup.\n\nAgent:\nAll right, for the MIDI issue, can you confirm what happens when you try to 'map your controller' and what is selected in the MusicBird hardware settings?\n\nCustomer:\nHey [NAME], any news on the stuttering issue? I'm thinking of trying MusicBird again but I'm hesitant until I know it's fixed. Is it a USB-related problem?\n\nAgent:\nHello! We've made some updates that may have improved the app. Try it out with your free account first and check if you're experiencing any stuttering. I've even unlocked your account for unlimited play time for a week.\n\nCustomer:\nThat sounds great, I'll give it another shot and let you know. Thanks, [NAME].",
    "Agent:\nHello, you've reached MusicBird support, how can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHey, I had a couple of questions about the subscription plans.\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, I'd be happy to help with that. What would you like to know?\n\nCustomer:\nIf I subscribe for an annual plan, does it renew automatically after a year? I want to be sure so I don't forget and get charged if I don't want it.\n\nAgent:\nYep, our subscriptions are set to auto-renew. But don't worry, we'll send you a reminder email before it renews, and you can cancel your subscription anytime and still keep access until it runs out.\n\nCustomer:\nOk, that's good to know. Also, I wanted to ask if you're planning to enable compatibility for 2x2x4 songs on a 2x8 midi controller?\n\nAgent:\nSure, typically any lesson that works with 2x2x4 configurations should work with a 2x8 controller. Have you found any lessons that aren't compatible?\n\nCustomer:\nThanks for the info. I'm not at that level yet, but I've noticed a bug. I'm sending a picture of the screen with my 2x8 controller showing a 2 2 4 error.\n\nAgent:\nSorry to hear that, but I'm glad you reported it. We should be able to add an 8x2 mapping for that. You can also customize it by mapping your controller. I\u2019m sending you a URL with a picture edited to guide you.\n\nCustomer:\nBrilliant, thank you!\n\nCustomer:\nBy the way, I tried subscribing, and it froze my account's cash. The bank's waiting for you to claim it.\n\nAgent:\nI'm sorry about that. Can you tell me if there was any error when processing your payment?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's a MasterCard from TransferWise, so it should work internationally. It was pending, but then it declined. I'll try again.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, by the way, I need to suspend my subscription. I'm not using MusicBird much these days, so I'll have to cancel.",
    "Agent:\nHello and welcome to MusicBird customer support, this is [NAME] speaking. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nOh, hi there. I'm glad I've finally reached you. I downloaded MusicBird but I'm still waiting on a response regarding a discount or donated subscription that I asked for.\n\nAgent:\nI understand, and I apologize for the wait. Can I have your name, please?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, it\u2019s [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nThanks, [NAME]. I see here that there was a mention of someone being sick. Are you referring to someone from our team?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, that's what I was told. Is everything alright there?\n\nAgent:\nAh, yes, they're recovering now, thank you for asking. Now, let's address your concern. You mentioned it\u2019s for music lessons with kids for your ministry?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, exactly. It's really urgent for us.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, got it. I'll do my best to prioritize this. It sounds like a very important cause.\n\nCustomer:\nI really appreciate that.\n\nAgent:\nOf course. Meanwhile, do you have an account set up with us or would you like to set up a new one?\n\nCustomer:\nYou can use this one, it's already set up.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. And would you be able to provide some official details about your work, just for our records?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I can send that over. It's quite late here, though, so it might take a little time.\n\nAgent:\nNo problem, [NAME]. Whenever you're able to.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks so much for understanding.\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, [NAME]. And it\u2019s wonderful to hear about your YouTube channel as well. I'll go ahead and unlock your account for a year to start.\n\nCustomer:\nA year? Wow, thank you, that's amazing!\n\nAgent:\nYou\u2019re very welcome! Just a small way we can help. If you need any advice or have questions about MusicBird, feel free to reach out.\n\nCustomer:\nWill do, and thank you once again, [NAME]. This really means a lot to us.\n\nAgent:\nNot a problem, [NAME]. You\u2019re doing great work, and we're happy to support it.\n\nCustomer:\nAnd if it's okay, I would love to send some pictures of the students using MusicBird.\n\nAgent:\nWe'd be thrilled to see them. Please send them over when you can.\n\nCustomer:\nI definitely will. And I might reach out again in the future if that's okay?\n\nAgent:\nOf course, [NAME]. We'd be glad to hear from you anytime. Have a fantastic day!\n\nCustomer:\nYou too, [NAME]. Blessings!\n\nAgent:\nBlessings to you as well, goodbye now.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for contacting MusicBird Support. My name is [NAME]. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, um, I need some clarification about my subscription. The latest renewal was on July 23rd, 2020, and it cost $26.99, right?\n\nAgent:\nYes, that's correct, your subscription did renew for $26.99. How can I help you further?\n\nCustomer:\nI see, do you have any other proposal for the renewal? Are there any options besides the $26.99 per month?\n\nAgent:\nYep, actually, we offer an annual subscription. It's $149.88 for the year, which averages out to $12.49 a month. That's quite a savings if you go for the annual option. Plus, we can keep your 10% discount, bringing it down to $134.89 for the year. Does that sound good to you?\n\nCustomer:\nOh, that's great! $134.89 for a year sounds perfect. I'll get back to you as soon as possible with my decision.\n\nAgent:\nSounds good, take your time and let me know if you decide to upgrade. I'm here to help!\n\nCustomer:\nHi again, [NAME], I've decided to upgrade. Can you help me make the change to an annual subscription for $134.89?\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, I'm happy to hear that. I've set up your upgrade to the annual plan for $134.89. This will take effect on your next renewal date, August 23rd. You'll receive a reminder email as well.\n\nCustomer:\n[NAME], I'm sorry, but I need to cancel the auto-renewal. My kids need to focus on their studies, so could you stop the renewal?\n\nAgent:\nNo trouble at all, I've canceled the auto-renewal for you. Your current subscription will remain active until August 23rd, 2021. If you want to resume later, just log into your account on our website, and you can reactivate your subscription at any time.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, fantastic. Thank you again for all your help, [NAME]. Best regards.",
    "Agent:\nHello, thank you for calling MusicBird support, this is [NAME] speaking. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi [NAME], I'm considering subscribing to MusicBird, but I've also looked at Synthesia and Flowkey. Each has something unique, so I'm weighing my options based on the price too. I found a 10% discount code online, but do you perhaps have a better deal for an annual subscription? That might help me decide.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I understand. We actually have a couple of promotional codes that could be of interest to you. For a monthly subscription, if you use \"MusicBird-IUSH158G\", it will give you 30% off for the first two months. And for an annual subscription, \"MusicBird-QYSG783R\" gives you 30% off for the first year. Would that be helpful for you?\n\nCustomer:\nThat sounds pretty good. Let me tell you what I like about the others though; Synthesia is super fast, I can start playing any song in just a few clicks. Haven't checked if MusicBird lets me use my own MIDI files since there's only a 5-minute trial. Flowkey's note detection is great too; tested it thoroughly because a friend had a free trial with their MIDI keyboard.\n\nCustomer:\nI really just want to have fun practicing on my keyboard. I'm into music production, so being able to improvise is my main goal, not necessarily reaching a high level of piano skill.\n\nAgent:\nSure, I see where you're coming from. Being able to use your own MIDI files is definitely possible with MusicBird; I can confirm that for you. And while we pride ourselves on the fun aspect, your feedback about what features you're looking for is truly valuable.\n\nCustomer:\nActually, I went ahead and chose MusicBird after all. Been playing for a few days and got a suggestion if you don't mind.\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, we're always looking for ways to improve. What's your suggestion?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, it would be nice to have feedback on missed notes and the fingers used. I tend to make more mistakes with some fingers, and having some data to track that would be awesome.\n\nCustomer:\nAlso, adding a \"random training\" feature could be useful. Parameters like note range, octaves, BPM, and step intervals would be handy. It's a bit like learning to type on a computer keyboard; you practice the keys rather than full words.\n\nAgent:\nThose are some really insightful suggestions, thank you. I'll be sure to pass that on to our product and development teams.\n\nCustomer:\nAnother thing, there's currently a $50 discount on the annual plan. I already have an account and the offer seems to be available to me. But it says it's for the first year only. Since I have an ongoing subscription, can I still get this discount?\n\nAgent:\nI appreciate you bringing this up. The offer is typically for new subscribers, but let me check on that for you. Can you give me a moment?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, no rush. As long as it's before the offer ends. My email is [EMAIL_ADDRESS], by the way.\n\nCustomer:\nIt's getting late here, so I'll probably finalize everything tomorrow.\n\nAgent:\nThank you for your patience, [NAME]. I've checked and for your case, we can honor the discount. I can update your account with the reduced price and renew your subscription right now, if you'd like?\n\nCustomer:\nAre you sure it won't apply automatically? I see the discount when I'm logged in. Doesn't the website know I'm not a new customer?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's clearly showing the price with the $50 off.\n\nCustomer:\nSo, the website wouldn't just show me the discount and then charge the full amount without telling me, right?",
    "Agent:\nHello and welcome to MusicBird customer support. This is [NAME]. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there! I've been using MusicBird and think it's an amazing tool. I'm a teacher for elementary and high school, and also run a music academy. I'm wondering how I could get my students to use MusicBird. Do you have any special pricing for teachers and students? Is there a special sign-up link for educators?\n\nAgent:\nOh, that's wonderful to hear that you're interested in incorporating MusicBird into your teaching! Yes, we do offer educational discounts, but it can vary depending on several factors.\n\nCustomer:\nThat's great! What kind of information do you need from me to get started?\n\nAgent:\nCould you tell me the number of students you'd like to have access to MusicBird, if you're considering a yearly or semester-based subscription, and the names of the schools you're affiliated with?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I have about 20 students at my private studio and I'm thinking a yearly subscription would be best. Unfortunately, I don't have a website for my studio, but I work with around 10 students at Freeport Christian Academy. Here's their website link. I'd like to explore using MusicBird for a full year. Could you give me a quote on that?\n\nAgent:\nThank you for the information, [NAME]. I'll work on a quote for you. Just a quick confirmation - are you able to make payments via PayPal or a direct bank deposit into a [ADDRESS] account? We don't accept cheques, and I need to make sure this won't be an issue.\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I can make the payment through PayPal. Please go ahead with the quote.\n\nAgent:\nThank you for confirming that. I'll have the quote ready for you shortly. Did you also want to include the option for the free one-month trial we're currently offering as part of our COVID-19 educational support program?\n\nCustomer:\nOh, that would be fantastic!\n\nAgent:\nGreat! So, including the free month, the discounted rate for the remaining months would come to USD $40 per license for 20 students. That totals USD $800 for the year. How does that sound to you?\n\nCustomer:\nThat sounds reasonable. Let me discuss it with my school and I'll get back to you.\n\nAgent:\nThat sounds perfect, [NAME]. Take the time you need and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions or when you're ready to proceed. Thank you for considering MusicBird for your teaching needs. Have a great day ahead!\n\nCustomer:\nYou're welcome, and thank you so much for your help, [NAME]!\n\nAgent:\nIt's my pleasure, Elder. Reach out anytime. Goodbye and take care!",
    "Agent:\nHi there! How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I was practicing and suddenly got logged out of my account. I tried my password, but it didn't work, so I hit the reset option. But I haven't received any reset email, and I'm worried about my streak. Can you help?\n\nAgent:\nOh, I see. Have you checked your spam or junk folder for the reset email by any chance?\n\nCustomer:\nLet me see. Nope, nothing there.\n\nAgent:\nAlright. What I can do for you right now is reset your password manually to 'MusicBird'. After you log in with that, you can change it under SETTINGS>ACCOUNT using the \"edit account\" option. Will that work for you?\n\nCustomer:\nUh-huh, that sounds good. Thanks!\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome. Also, let me know if you have any more issues, okay?\n\nCustomer:\nActually, [NAME], I'm having another issue. My practice session from yesterday didn't fully track. It recorded my keys but not my pads. I should be at a 404-day streak. Can you fix it?\n\nAgent:\nSure, [NAME], I can help with that. I'll just need a moment to adjust your streak.\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, sure.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I've updated your streak. Can you check in the app now and see if it's correct?\n\nCustomer:\nChecking. Yeah, it's all good now. Thank you!\n\nAgent:\nFantastic! If you need anything else, just let us know. Happy practicing!",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for calling MusicBird, my name is [NAME]. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I realized my subscription was renewed without my knowledge. I didn't use the last one and I'd like to cancel and get a refund, please.\n\nAgent:\nI see, I'm really sorry to hear that. Can I have your account details to check on this for you?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, it's [NAME] .\n\nAgent:\nThank you, [NAME]. Let me pull up your account. Just a moment.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay.\n\nAgent:\nAlright [NAME], like other streaming services, our subscriptions auto-renew. However, I can definitely cancel your account and issue a refund for the latest payment.\n\nCustomer:\nThat would be great, thanks.\n\nAgent:\nThe refund process is started on my end. It may take a couple of days to reflect in your account. And remember, if you ever want to come back, just let us know. We'll reactivate your account.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks, [NAME]. I'll look for the refund. Appreciate your help.\n\nAgent:\nIt's my pleasure, [NAME]. Anything else I can do for you today?\n\nCustomer:\nActually, it's been a month and I still haven't seen the refund.\n\nAgent:\nAh, I'm really sorry about that. Let's sort it out right now. One moment, I'll process that refund for you immediately.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, thank you.\n\nAgent:\nAll done! The refund has been processed. You should see it in your account in a few days.

    "Agent:\nHi, thank you for calling our support center. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm trying to connect my MPC Live with MusicBird on my M1 MacBook Air, and I'm not sure if it's supported. The computer seems to recognize it, but I can't get it to work with the software.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, that definitely should work. Have you tried putting your MPC Live into \"Controller Mode\"?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I have, and.\n\nAgent:\nOk, and once it's in Controller Mode, have you gone into MusicBird's settings and clicked the \"Map your controller\" button?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I did that. But.\n\nAgent:\nSo, what's happening exactly when you hit \"Map Your Controller\"?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, the mapping window opens, but I can't do anything because the MPC doesn't show up in the \"Selected Device\" list.\n\nAgent:\nHmm, I see. And do you have any other software open that might be conflicting with MusicBird?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I made sure to close everything else, but it's still not showing up.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. Okay, let me check something real quick. Uh, could you hold for a moment?",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for calling MusicBird support. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm kinda nervous. I lost all my streaks when I switched to a new computer!\n\nAgent:\nI see, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the issue?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, I did my lesson today, had a 117-day streak, and now it's showing zero on the new PC.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, got it. Let\u2019s see what we can do. Have you checked if the correct instrument is selected on your new machine?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, let me. Yes, it's correct.\n\nAgent:\nAlright. Can you see if your specific lesson scores are there or if it's just the streak and level that's incorrect?\n\nCustomer:\nThe lessons and minutes are still there, but my best and current streaks say zero days.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. And did you use different devices to practice, by any chance?\n\nCustomer:\nI only switched from an old to a new PC. The streaks are gone on both now.\n\nAgent:\nHmm, were you connected to the internet while using the old device?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, always. But it looks like the streak didn\u2019t transfer over to the new one.\n\nAgent:\nI understand. It's important to close the MusicBird app after each session to sync progress. Can you still access your old computer to check the streak there?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I still have the old one. I'll check it later.\n\nAgent:\nPlease do that. It\u2019s also possible it didn't sync correctly with our servers. But don't worry, we'll sort this out for you.\n\nCustomer:\nThank you, I really don't want to lose my streak. This keeps me motivated to practice.\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, let\u2019s get to the bottom of this. We might need to manually fix your streak. Can you tell me roughly how many days you practiced on which instrument?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, it's the keyboard and it was 117 days.\n\nAgent:\nGreat, thank you. I'll take a look at this and get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nCustomer:\nThank you so much!\n\nAgent:\nHello, this is [NAME] from MusicBird. Can I speak to [NAME] please?\n\nCustomer:\nSpeaking, hi [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nHi [NAME], I've got some good news. We looked into your account, and I can see your streak is now showing as 119 days, which seems correct. Your progress should now be properly syncing with our servers.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, that's great to hear! I figured out a temporary solution on my own, but it's good to know.\n\nAgent:\nOh, you did? Can you tell me what you did, just for our records?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I moved some files from my old PC to the new one. It was a bit technical.\n\nAgent:\nRight. Well, in future, we hope to make that process much smoother for you. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's everything. Thank you for your help!\n\nAgent:\nMy pleasure, [NAME]. Thank you for contacting MusicBird support and have a great day. Keep up the practice!\n\nCustomer:\nWill do, bye!",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for calling MusicBird support, my name is [NAME]. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I can't seem to log in using Facebook. It keeps giving me an error message about the app being in development mode or something.\n\nAgent:\nI'm sorry to hear you're having trouble. Okay, let me look into that for you. Have you previously created an account with us using an email address?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's possible it could be another email. Can you check if you have anything under [EMAIL_ADDRESS]?\n\nAgent:\nHmm, just a moment while I check that for you. No, it doesn't seem like we have an account with that email. Can you recall what username you might have used?\n\nCustomer:\nI'm not certain, but I generally go by djruid, dreamtunnel, djoprhix, or orphix on most platforms.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, let me try those. Unfortunately, I can't find any accounts linked to those usernames either. Do you have any emails from us that might confirm your registration?\n\nCustomer:\nThat's the thing, I don't have any emails, but I know I've had a paid subscription for over a year.\n\nAgent:\nStrange. Could you provide me your full name and the last four digits of the card you might have used or, if it was PayPal, the associated email?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, check this debit card, the last four digits are 3350.\n\nAgent:\nThank you, give me just a moment. It appears there were subscriptions with that card number, but they were both cancelled. Can you send over transaction screenshots from your bank statements showing payments to MusicBird?\n\nCustomer:\nI can't do that right now, I can't log in to MusicBird to find the transactions.\n\nAgent:\nI understand the difficulty. We're struggling to find any accounts or payments without more information. Did you possibly use PayPal for your payments?\n\nCustomer:\nI can't remember exactly. No emails, remember? Try this card ending in 7807, please.\n\nAgent:\nOne moment. Ah, here we go, that card number is linked to an email that starts with the letters [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Does [EMAIL_ADDRESS] sound familiar?\n\nCustomer:\nOh, that's my old email address, [EMAIL_ADDRESS].\n\nAgent:\nGreat, we've made progress! That's the email your subscription is under. I'll reset your password to a generic one for now. Once you log in, you can change it in the settings. Your temporary password is 'MusicBird'.\n\nCustomer:\nThat worked, thank you! By the way, I can't figure out how to cancel the auto-renewal. Could you cancel it for me?\n\nAgent:\nSure thing. I'll handle that for you. and there, your auto-renewal has been cancelled. You still have 80 days left on your current subscription. Remember, you can practice until then! Anything else I can help with?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's all. Thank you so much for your help.",
    "Agent:\nHello, thank you for calling MusicBird customer support. My name is [NAME]. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, hi. I need help because my subscription got canceled and I didn\u2019t cancel it myself.\n\nAgent:\nI understand. That must be frustrating. Let's take a look at what happened. One moment, please.\n\nCustomer:\nSure, thank you.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I see here that the subscription was canceled because there was no payment method on file for the renewal. To continue enjoying MusicBird, you'll need to resubscribe with updated payment details.\n\nCustomer:\nDone. But it\u2019s asking me to update my info on the website again.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh. I can confirm your details haven\u2019t been updated yet. Can you try to update your information via the website, please?\n\nCustomer:\nYep, I tried the link.\n\nAgent:\nYou're experiencing issues with it?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I managed to do it, but just confirming that it's done on your end too?\n\nAgent:\nSure, let me double-check that for you. Alright, it hasn\u2019t updated on our end. You'll need to actually start a new subscription because the old one was canceled.\n\nCustomer:\nWait, so I have to start over?\n\nAgent:\nYes, you need to resubscribe. However, I can offer a 30% discount code for the annual plan to help you out. It's MusicBird-IUYG984A.\n\nCustomer:\nStrange. I did it again and now it seems to be confirmed.\n\nAgent:\nGreat to hear that! Uh-huh, everything looks updated now. Anything else I can help you with?\n\nCustomer:\nActually, yes. My Presonus Atom SQ isn\u2019t supported. Can you help with that too?\n\nAgent:\nOf course. Have you checked the iPad connection guide yet? Also, try reverting all mappings back to default in your MusicBird settings, then create a custom mapping.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay. I'll give that a go. Thanks, [NAME].",
    "Agent:\nHello, you've reached our support center. My name is [NAME]. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, [NAME]. So, when I try to play the two newest funk songs on my iPad, I'm having some trouble.\n\nAgent:\nWhat kind of trouble are you experiencing with the songs?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, the song loads to the preview screen, but then there's no audio. The drum animation starts but freezes immediately, then it just kicks me back to the song selection screen.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, have you tried any troubleshooting steps on your own so far?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I've closed the app, rebooted the iPad, and also tried on my Mac. It plays fine on the Mac, just not on the iPad.\n\nAgent:\nInteresting. And all the other songs are playing as expected on your iPad?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, everything else works great. I'm really loving the new iPad update, by the way.\n\nAgent:\nGreat to hear you like the update! I'm sorry about these specific songs though. Just to confirm, did you say this issue occurs on both of the new funk songs?\n\nCustomer:\nExactly, both of them.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, let me just note this down. Uh-huh. Have you tried reinstalling the app, by any chance?\n\nCustomer:\nActually, I just reinstalled it and signed back in before this call. The problem is still there.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. That's very helpful to know. I'm going to relay this to our technical team.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, I hope it gets resolved soon.\n\nAgent:\nCan you confirm if you're using identical setups on both the iPad and the Mac?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, it's the same Alesis Nitro kit. The cable's different but that's about it. I even double-checked by plugging into the MacBook and it worked there but still failed on the iPad.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, alright. I appreciate the details. I'll have to speak to the team about this. We'll do some testing here in the office as I don't have an iPad handy to try it out immediately.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, thanks. I appreciate it, [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nNo worries, we'll do our best to get this fixed. I'll update you as soon as I have more information. Thank you for calling us, [NAME].\n\nCustomer:\nThanks for your help. Have a good day!",

We're non-profit and looking to use MusicBird in our teachings. Is there a reduced cost available for educational use?\n\nAgent:\nI see, [NAME]. Yeah, we definitely have some options for schools and educational groups.\n\nCustomer:\nAlso, could we get some kind of reduction on hardware?\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh. We do have connections with hardware partners.

Let me loop in [NAME] from our education team who can give more details on licenses and I'll see what I can do about the hardware.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks, [NAME], that's great.\n\nAgent:\nHi [NAME], [NAME] here from the education team. To help you out, I need to know how many licenses you'll need? And for how long?\n\nCustomer:\nHey [NAME]. Not sure about the exact number as we\u2019re just starting up again, but could you give me a price for a single educational license and maybe for a group of 5 or 10?\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, sure thing. And you mentioned term time mainly but also during summer and school breaks?\n\nCustomer:\nExactly. We're mostly active during the term but we continue throughout school holidays.\n\nAgent:\nGreat, let me work out something for you based on that info and I'll come back with a good offer. Keen to support you guys.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks, [NAME], that would be helpful.\n\nCustomer:\nHi [NAME], I'm just following up about the educational pricing for MusicBird?\n\nAgent:\nYeah, [NAME], we've been working on that.

It's not really my area of expertise, but I'll ask around the team for you.\n\nCustomer:\nThat'd be great, thanks.

    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for reaching out. Let's see if we can sort out the issue with your apps. First off, I'm really sorry to hear about the trouble you're having.\n\nCustomer:\nI'm just really frustrated. I've been working hard to maintain my streak and now it seems like it's all for nothing.\n\nAgent:\nI totally understand the frustration. Let's try and get this resolved for you as quickly as possible. Can you confirm for me if you have the correct instrument selected on your app?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, the right instrument is selected. That's not the issue.\n\nAgent:\nAlright. Can you tell me a bit more then, is it the scores on certain lessons that are missing or just your streak and level that seems incorrect?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, it's my streak that's gone. I practiced for so many days straight.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. Do you happen to remember how many days your streak was?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I don't remember exactly, but it was a lot!\n\nAgent:\nOkay, no problem, we'll do our best to figure this out. Now, do you use different devices for your practices or just stick to one?\n\nCustomer:\nI use both my PC and iPad, but I always make sure to close the app properly.\n\nAgent:\nThat's good to know. And are you always connected to the internet while practicing?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, most of the time, but sometimes the connection is spotty.\n\nAgent:\nHmm, unreliable internet might be a factor here, but we'll check on our end. Do you ever use your iPad and PC to practice at the same time?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I never do that.\n\nAgent:\nExcellent, you're doing everything right then. Can I ask if your network is private or do you use a public network sometimes?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's a private network at home.\n\nAgent:\nGreat, thanks for that information. Have you tried restarting your iPad to see if that helps refresh the connection and restore your streak?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I haven't tried that yet.\n\nAgent:\nCould you give that a go? Sometimes a simple restart can help.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, I'll do that now.\n\nAgent:\nOkay. While we\u2019re at it, can you please confirm you\u2019re not practicing on multiple machines at the same time?\n\nCustomer:\nI\u2019m definitely not, I\u2019ve made sure of that.\n\nAgent:\nPerfect. If a restart doesn't sort it out, we'll take a deeper look into this. I really want to make sure we get your streak restored.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, I restarted my iPad. I'm just relaunching the app. but my streak is still missing.\n\nAgent:\nI see, sorry to hear that didn't work. I'm going to escalate this issue to our tech team to get a closer look. I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t fix it on the spot, but I assure you we\u2019ll do our best to resolve this and prevent it from happening again in the future.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, just please hurry.

I like to cycle between hobbies, and I was really impressed by how you handled my cancellation. Can I still get that discount?\n\nAgent:\nHello again, [NAME]! Hope you've been well.

You're having trouble with slow response times in our app, correct?\n\nCustomer:\nExactly, it's really slow. It takes like six seconds every time I start an event, and it's pretty frustrating.\n\nAgent:\nI understand how that can be frustrating. I see here you've already tried reinstalling the app. Did that not make any difference?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, none at all. I did exactly as we discussed - deleted and then reinstalled. But it's still the same.\n\nAgent:\nI see. And you mentioned you've sent across some details about your iPad as well as a video showing the problem?\n\nCustomer:\nYep, sent it all through. I included the model, the OS version, and the storage details.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, thank you for doing that. Let me just pull up the information you sent. Uh-huh, I have it now.\n\nCustomer:\nGreat. So, can you see what's wrong?\n\nAgent:\nI'm actually looking at your storage details and. ah, my apologies, I see it's already included in the image you sent. No need to provide it again.\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I included that screenshot so you'd have everything.\n\nAgent:\nApologies for the confusion earlier. Thank you for that.

But what I'll do is escalate this to our technical team and get back to you as soon as I have an update.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, please do that. It's pretty important for me to have the app working smoothly.\n\nAgent:\nUnderstood. I'm treating this as a priority.

    "Agent:\nHello, this is [NAME] from MusicBird support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm having trouble with the app. It's telling me I've used my 5 minutes and need to subscribe to continue, but I've already paid for a subscription.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, let's see what we can do about that. Did you happen to receive a gift code or something similar that you want to use?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I didn't get a gift code. I'm wondering though, can we remove my account completely and start over with a gift card maybe?\n\nAgent:\nI see. I don't think removing the account is necessary at this stage. Have you tried clearing the local data or reinstalling the app?\n\nCustomer:\nYep, done all that. Same problem. Still asking me to subscribe.\n\nAgent:\nOkay. Can you confirm if you're using the latest version of the app for me?\n\nCustomer:\nI should be. I'll have to check on that.\n\nAgent:\nPlease do that, [NAME]. Also, I've removed and added you back into a full access account to try and reset your access. This won't affect your payment, don't worry.\n\nCustomer:\nGot it. I'll uninstall and reinstall the latest version then. But I can't do it right now, grandkids are over.\n\nAgent:\nNo problem at all, [NAME]. Just let us know how it goes after you try.\n\nCustomer:\nSorry for the late update. I've followed your instructions \u2013 deleted and reinstalled MusicBird. Still having the same problem.

No luck at all.\n\nCustomer:\nAnd I'm a bit confused. Can't send a folder, so here's the contents.\n\nAgent:\nThank you for that, [NAME]. By the way, have you changed your password recently? Also, would you allow us to log into your account to check things from our end?\n\nCustomer:\nChanged it.

We'll be in touch again soon.\n\nAgent:\nGood news, [NAME]. We managed to access the content with no issues. Can you try logging out and in again with the details I've provided? Also, check if you can get to your subscription details on the website. If not, let's try deleting the MusicBird file and reinstall.\n\nCustomer:\nThank you.\n\nCustomer:\nI'll give it a shot, but I might need another beer first to tackle this one.\n\nAgent:\nI understand it's a lot, [NAME]. Your patience is really appreciated. If it all works out, we'll extend your subscription for the trouble.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, under my username and new password, I see this.\n\nAgent:\nGreat, that's a start. Can you log out and log back in on our website inside that screen?\n\nCustomer:\nSorry, it's been a while. Wife's been ill and I forgot my password for a bit. Only the 'MusicBird' password works, not my usual one. Should I reset it? Also, do you have gift cards for accounts?\n\nAgent:\nI'm sorry to hear about your wife, [NAME], hoping for her quick recovery. Yes, please reset your password. And about your question, we don't have gift accounts, but I can offer you a discount on a new account in the future. Or we can pause your current subscription.\n\nCustomer:\nOnly some lessons work for 5 minutes. I'll try resetting my password. Wish me luck.\n\nAgent:\nFingers crossed! Also, please update the app if you haven't done so already. If the problem persists, could you send us some files from a specific folder?",
    "Agent:\nHello and welcome to MusicBird support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, my accounts exercises have completely been removed. Can you help me get them back?\n\nAgent:\nI see, I'll certainly try to help you with that. Were you subscribed to the full version of MusicBird by any chance?\n\nCustomer:\nI actually have paid for MusicBird, so I don't know why you're asking that.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, sorry for any confusion. There might be an issue with the subscription not showing up. Could it be under a different email possibly?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, it should all be under this email.\n\nAgent:\nOk, let me check on that for you. Also, could you tell me more about the issue with the crash? When did this start happening?\n\nCustomer:\nSince it crashed, I haven't used MusicBird anymore. I used to practice daily, but not since the crash.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let's see if we can get to the bottom of this. I'm going to need a bit more information about the crashes. Can you describe what happens when it crashes?\n\nCustomer:\nIt just shuts down. I try to open it and mid-session, it\u2019s gone.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, that's definitely not supposed to happen. I appreciate you letting me know. I'll need to escalate this to our tech team so they can take a closer look. In the meantime, could you try logging in just one more time for me, just to see if anything\u2019s changed?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I'll give it another try, but this is really frustrating.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, and I totally understand the frustration. Please know, we're going to do everything we can to resolve this for you. Once you\u2019ve tried logging in, could you tell me if anything is different?\n\nCustomer:\nIt still doesn't work, the same issue.\n\nAgent:\nOk, I\u2019ve noted that down. We\u2019ll get our tech team on this and update you as soon as we have a fix. In the meantime, I'd like to offer you a week of free access while we sort out the subscription issue. How does that sound?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, that's something, I guess. How will you update me?\n\nAgent:\nWe'll send you an email update as soon as we have more information. I\u2019ll add a note here to make sure you\u2019re on the priority list for an update.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, I'll be waiting. Thank you.\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll speak soon. Have a great day!\n\nCustomer:\nYou too, bye.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, this is the MusicBird helpdesk, how can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nI need to speak to someone ASAP.\n\nAgent:\nSure, I'm here to help. Could you please tell me what the issue is?\n\nCustomer:\nI need my account cancelled.\n\nAgent:\nOk, no problem. Could you please provide me with the email address associated with your account?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's [EMAIL_ADDRESS].\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, I'm checking it now. It seems that there's no account under this email address. Could you possibly have another email you might've used, or could you provide your username?\n\nCustomer:\nMy username is Memaov3.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, I'm checking. Sorry, but there's no account with that username either. Is there any other information that might help us find your account?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, this company has been taking $29.99 out of my account for a while now. I didn't authorize this. I need it to stop.\n\nAgent:\nI understand, let's get this sorted out. Did you pay with Paypal or a credit card?\n\nCustomer:\nDebit card.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, can you tell me the last four digits of your card so I can locate your account that way?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's 1453.\n\nAgent:\nOk, one moment. I\u2019ve found an account, but the email doesn't match the one you gave me. Does [EMAIL_ADDRESS] sound familiar?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, it does not.\n\nAgent:\nI'm sorry to hear about the unwanted charges. We're going to sort this out. Can you tell me how long this has been going on?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I haven\u2019t been able to log in at all. And about the account you mentioned, I don't know anything about that email.\n\nAgent:\nI see. Could you provide any screenshots of these payments from your bank statement? That might help us track this down.\n\nCustomer:\nThese are still pending, but look at last month\u2019s charges, you charged me two or three times on some of them.\n\nAgent:\nThank you for that information. And these weren't through PayPal, right?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, it\u2019s straight from my bank.\n\nAgent:\nCould you let us know who your card issuer is? Just the name of the bank would help.\n\nCustomer:\nIt\u2019s Pentagon Federal Credit Union.\n\nAgent:\nThanks, [NAME]. We think we've found the account. We're issuing a refund right now. When you see it, could you confirm the amount for us?\n\nCustomer:\nOk. But there have been charges for months, this goes way beyond January.\n\nAgent:\nOf course, [NAME]. As soon as you confirm the refund, we can proceed with the remaining refunds. Again, we're sorry for any inconvenience this has caused you.\n\nCustomer:\nYou're still taking money out, even yesterday!!!\n\nAgent:\nI'm so sorry about this. More refunds were issued today, please check and confirm them as soon as they appear.\n\nCustomer:\nI have received a refund of $3.27.",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for calling MusicBird customer support, my name is [NAME]. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there. I'm trying to cancel my subscription to MusicBird, but I'm stuck because I can't log into my account. Also, I haven't been getting any emails to reset my password.\n\nAgent:\nOh, I see. Let's try and sort this out for you. Have you perhaps registered an account with this specific email address? I'm not finding any accounts associated with it.\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I think the problem might be that I mistyped my email when I signed up because I don't really have another email address.\n\nAgent:\nAlright. Could you please provide me with your username, just in case we can locate your account that way?\n\nCustomer:\nOh, yes, my username should be hujjee.\n\nAgent:\nThanks for that information. Okay, I found an account with a similar email address. Could it possibly be [EMAIL_ADDRESS]?\n\nCustomer:\nAh, yes, that sounds like it could be me.\n\nAgent:\nGreat! I've gone ahead and reset the password for you. The temporary password is 'MusicBird'. You should be able to log in with this password, and then you can change it to something more secure in your account settings under the \"edit account\" button.\n\nCustomer:\nThank you so much, dear.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for contacting MusicBird support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I've recently had quite a few issues with the app. Several bugs and crashes. For instance, the song \"Queensbridge\" in Grade 4 isn't working at all. Also, I've lost 3 months of progress, and I'm pretty upset about that.\n\nAgent:\nI see, that sounds frustrating. Could you provide me with more details about the problems with \"Queensbridge\" and the other issues?\n\nCustomer:\nSure. So, when I try \"Queensbridge,\" it shows a keyboard with no yellow or blue keys. Also, I'm using an Arturia KeyStep, and there's no response whatsoever. The missed notes are a big problem too, they happen so often in practice mode.\n\nAgent:\nYeah, I understand. And what about crashes?\n\nCustomer:\nThe crashes are random. They can happen when playing songs, browsing the song list, or when exiting the post-song screen. It's quite annoying.\n\nAgent:\nRight. Now, regarding your progress, are you using MusicBird on multiple devices by any chance?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I've used it both on my laptop and desktop. It used to sync fine, but now my progress isn't reflecting on both.\n\nAgent:\nOk, it seems like it could be a sync issue. A tip for the future is to close the app between sessions, this should help with syncing. I'll report all these problems to our tech team.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks, and please, stop mixing up my email with other tickets. I've received emails meant for other people.\n\nAgent:\nOh, I apologize for that inconvenience. We'll look into this email issue as well. I appreciate your patience and the information you've provided.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, I hope these issues are resolved soon. Thanks for your help.\n\nAgent:\nOf course. We'll do our best to fix these as quickly as possible. If you have any other questions or more information to share later, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!\n\nCustomer:\nWill do. Bye.",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for calling MusicBird support, this is [NAME]. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there, I've been using MusicBird for drums and really like it. I was wondering if you guys have any songs available to play along with?\n\nAgent:\nHi [NAME], it's great to hear you're enjoying MusicBird. Regarding your question, we do have lessons based on some 'real songs' from collaborating artists, but we don't offer popular hits due to licensing challenges. However, we are working on it. Any particular artists or songs you're interested in?\n\nCustomer:\nActually, I'm quite new to drumming, so I might stick with the beginner lessons for now. They are quite challenging. Also, I wanted to mention that I really like the \"Wait,\" and \"Auto BPM\" features. By the way, I'm almost 70, so my progress might be slower. I tried Drumeo, but I prefer MusicBird, especially since I can use my headphones and not disturb my wife.\n\nAgent:\nThat's wonderful to hear, [NAME]. I\u2019m thrilled to know our features are helping you out. Given that you're a beginner, you might find the MusicBird tags really useful to focus on specific skills. Also, our learning page has got a bunch of extra resources you might find handy.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks for the tips. I appreciate it.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, wait, I already asked about the songs. Sorry about that. If you did have songs to play along with, I'd be happy with any type, really. A variety would be nice.\n\nAgent:\nNo worries at all, [NAME]. Your feedback is valuable. Do let us know if you have favorite artists or genres. We're always looking to improve our selection.\n\nCustomer:\nWell, I like rock music, any type really. I saw a competitor was offering a way to learn a specific song by breaking it down, which sounded good. Playing songs feels like the best part, kind of why I enjoy MusicBird too, I like the real-time feedback and the pace adjustment.\n\nAgent:\nThat's really insightful, Marvin. Rock music has a variety, and learning through songs can be such a rewarding experience. I'll make sure to pass your thoughts along to our team. Have a wonderful day.",
    "Agent:\nHello, thank you for calling MusicBird Support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm having trouble logging into the MusicBird app. It works fine on the website, but not the app. My subscription\u2019s active too.\n\nAgent:\nOkay. Are you getting any error messages when you try to log into the app?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, but I've entered the right password. It keeps showing the same error message.\n\nAgent:\nI see, could you please check if you're using any proxies or VPNs that could interfere with the connection to our servers?\n\nCustomer:\nHere, I've sent you the screenshot of the error.\n\nCustomer:\nAnd I noticed I was charged for my subscription.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, let me take a look. Now, I\u2019ll need you to send me some log files. Can you find the MusicBird log folders on your system and zip those for me?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I can do that. One moment.\n\nAgent:\nAlso, could you check your network settings? Ensure your \"SOCKS Proxy\" is turned off in the system preferences?\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, here are the files from the logs.\n\nCustomer:\nI checked, and here's a screenshot of my proxy settings. Should I keep the SOCKS Proxy checked?\n\nAgent:\nThank you for that. Please go ahead and uncheck the SOCKS proxy, apply the changes, then try logging in again.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, done. Looks like it worked! I'm logged in now.\n\nAgent:\nFantastic. Keeping your SOCKS proxy unchecked is recommended since it might block our servers sometimes, depending on its configuration.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks for the help, man. Appreciate it!",
    "Agent:\nHello, MusicBird support speaking, how can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nOh, hi there. I'd like to know if I'll get a reminder before my subscription auto-renews. It's not up until November, but I want to check before then.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I understand. You're interested in receiving a notification before renewal, right?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, exactly. I saw something worrying on Facebook about being charged without notice, and that's not what I want.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, I see where you're coming from. I can confirm that we do send out renewal notifications prior to charging your account.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, wonderful, that's a relief to hear. Thank you.\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your subscription?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, actually, I need to cancel my subscription. The teaching style doesn't suit me, unfortunately.\n\nAgent:\nOh, I'm sorry to hear that. May I ask what specifically wasn't working for you?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, it's the learning style of MusicBird. It got too challenging for me, especially keeping up with identifying the voices on the screen.\n\nAgent:\nI understand. That sounds frustrating. I'm sorry our method didn't match your learning style.\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I've moved on to learning actual drum notation, and it's going much better for me.\n\nAgent:\nThat's good to hear! I'll process your cancellation. And just so you know, if you ever want to come back, we can reactivate your account, and you won't lose any progress.\n\nCustomer:\nThat's good to know; I appreciate the flexibility.

    "Agent:\nGood morning, welcome to MusicBird support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHello, I've got a problem with the app. It's telling me I didn't practice yesterday but I did, and it showed my 90-day streak. Now it doesn't even show the song I was practicing on the home page.\n\nAgent:\nOh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let's see if we can sort this out for you. Have you made sure you've got the right instrument selected on the app?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I've got the correct instrument. This issue's only happened once, so I'm not sure if it's lesson-specific. Basically, my streak's the only thing that's incorrect, showing no progress for yesterday. And yes, I use the same iPad every day and it's always connected to the internet.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I understand. I've made an update on our end to fix your streak. Could you check your app now and see if it reflects the correct information?\n\nCustomer:\nNope, it\u2019s still saying I didn't have progress on Monday, now my streak's broken.\n\nAgent:\nSorry about that, I've updated it again. Can you please close and reopen your app and check it for me?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's actually worse now. It's saying I didn't practice on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nCustomer:\nAnd it seems like each update is erasing my previous day\u2019s progress. I've already practiced today, and I'm waiting to see what it does now.\n\nAgent:\nThat's not good at all, I apologize. Are you making sure to close down the MusicBird app properly between sessions?\n\nCustomer:\nYep.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, thanks for that. Let me know if your streak stays updated correctly now, or if it's still off.\n\nCustomer:\nNo change, it's still not right.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, thank you for letting me know. Have you had any similar issues when using a PC, or is it just the iPad?\n\nCustomer:\nI only use the iPad, and it's not fixed yet.\n\nAgent:\nCould you try restarting the iPad to see if that helps sync the streak? Also, are you using the app on a private network like at home?\n\nCustomer:\nI restart the iPad every day because I never leave it on. And yeah, I\u2019m on my home network, no VPN. The PC app even says my streak is broken, and it breaks every day I practice.\n\nAgent:\nI'm really sorry about this. I'm going to pass this on to our team to look into it. In the meantime, can you tell me how many days you were up to on your streak for each instrument?\n\nCustomer:\nAccording to today, I'm on a 26-day streak.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, thank you. On our end, we're seeing something different. I'd like to confirm with you if your streak is still updating correctly now without any gaps. And is the streak consistent on both your iPad and computer?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, there are still gaps. The PC and iPad were showing different streaks before I synchronized them. But I don't actually use the PC version.\n\nAgent:\nI'm really sorry this is still happening. To make up for the trouble, I've added two extra months to your subscription. Your new renewal date is the 3rd of February, 2022. We appreciate your patience! Keep on practicing, and please keep us updated.",
    "Agent:\nHello and welcome to MusicBird support, this is [NAME] speaking, how can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I've just bought a set of Roland V-Drums and it came with a flyer for your app, which I've already downloaded on my iPad. The flyer mentioned I could unlock 40 free lessons but I can't figure out how to do it on the app. Can you guide me?\n\nAgent:\nHey there! Thank you for reaching out to us. To access those lessons, you'll need a MusicBird account with a subscription. Do you have a Mac or Windows PC where you can create an account?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I created an account already, my username is Drummer Mama, but I haven't subscribed yet.\n\nAgent:\nGreat, [NAME] Mama! Log in to your account and I'm going to set you up with a week of free access on your iPad app. Check it out and see what you think.\n\nCustomer:\nGot it, I'll give that a try. Thank you, [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! By the way, I\u2019m just checking in to see how you're enjoying the app. Did you get a chance to try those lessons?\n\nCustomer:\nOh, I've been swamped with mom duties and haven't tried it yet. Hopefully, this week I'll get some time.\n\nAgent:\nNo worries at all, [NAME]. Whenever you're ready, just let us know and we'll arrange another week of free access for you, okay?\n\nCustomer:\nThat would be great, thanks so much!",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for calling MusicBird support, how can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there, I've run into a bit of a problem. I lost my 193-day streak because of some unforeseen issues. It's past midnight now\u2014actually, it's 1:23 AM\u2014and I'm worried about my streak.\n\nAgent:\nOh no, I'm sorry to hear that, [NAME]. Streaks are important, I get it. Let me see what we can do on our end.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks, I\u2019d really appreciate it. I just don't think I'd be motivated to start it all over again.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, I understand. Give me just a moment here. Okay, I\u2019ve made an update on your account. Could you check your app to ensure your streak has been restored?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, give me a second. Wow, there it is! Thank you so much for fixing that, [NAME]. I was worried I wouldn't find the motivation again.\n\nAgent:\nYou're very welcome, [NAME]! It's great to see your dedication. Just keep practicing, alright?\n\nCustomer:\nAbsolutely, will do. By the way, you wouldn't happen to know if MusicBird is hiring a Salesforce developer or administrator, would you?\n\nAgent:\nIt's great you're interested in joining the team! You can check out our current openings on our careers page, and the best way to apply is directly through there.\n\nCustomer:\nGot it, I'll have a look. Thanks. Oh, right, my streak seems to have reset again; I practiced yesterday on the train, and then again around 2 AM this morning. Could this be because of a bad connection?\n\nAgent:\nHmm, I see. Yeah, that could be a factor. I'll take care of that for you right now. And about your question, the 5-minute session streaks are per instrument, so if you switch between instruments, just keep up each streak separately.\n\nCustomer:\nUnderstood, [NAME]. I\u2019ll hold off on buying the keyboard for now then. Interesting times. I'm kind of in a bind because I missed my practice session. Things have been tough; I'm going through a breakup and have to move around a bit. Can you help me with the streak one more time?\n\nAgent:\nI'm really sorry to hear you're going through that, [NAME]. Let me fix that streak for you right away. Could you do a quick check in the app and let me know if it's all good?\n\nCustomer:\nI'll take a look now. Yes, it's all sorted. Thanks for making that happen so quickly, [NAME]. I'll reach out if I need more help.",
    "Agent:\nHello, you're through to MusicBird support. My name is [NAME]. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there! I had an idea for a feature while I was using your app in practice mode. I usually slow down pieces to manage them and then speed up as I improve. I thought, what if there was a button to automate this process?\n\nAgent:\nOh, I'm glad to hear you're actively using the practice mode. So you're suggesting an automated way to increase the BPM as you play better, right?\n\nCustomer:\nExactly! You could set how many perfect repetitions before it speeds up, whether perfection is required for the increase, and the size of the increase in BPM.\n\nAgent:\nI see. You know, we actually have an 'Auto BPM' function that does something similar. It increases the speed by 5 BPM as you get the piece right, until it's at the original tempo.\n\nCustomer:\nReally? I must've missed that. Can you adjust how well you have to play before it increases the speed?\n\nAgent:\nAs of now, it's a fixed setting. But your idea of adding more adjustability sounds excellent. I'll definitely pass your suggestions to the team.\n\nCustomer:\nThat\u2019s great! I'm curious about if that was already a feature, or if I sparked a new idea.\n\nAgent:\nThe function has been there for some time, but we love getting user feedback to improve. I\u2019ll ensure we take your feedback into account for future updates.\n\nCustomer:\nAwesome! Thanks for helping me out, and for considering my idea.\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, [NAME]. It's what we're here for! If you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out. Take care and happy practicing!\n\nCustomer:\nWill do, [NAME]. Thanks again!",

Gimme a second.\n\nCustomer:\nSure.\n\nAgent:\nYou said it's a 3-year subscription, right?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, that's correct. [NAME] actually set me up with this subscription.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I see.

You can find a list of our supported devices and the setup guide on our website. The links are [URL] and [URL].\n\nCustomer:\nOh, and what cables will I need for that?\n\nAgent:\nYou just need a USB-B cable to connect your drums to your computer.\n\nCustomer:\nGot it. Also, is it possible to subscribe to the annual plan but start it later? I haven't bought the e-drum yet.\n\nAgent:\nUnfortunately, you can't delay the start date of the subscription, but our sale is on for a few more days. You can still use MusicBird with your computer keyboard in the meantime.\n\nCustomer:\nWhat is a USB-B cable?\n\nAgent:\nIt's a standard type of cable, often used with printers. You can find them at any electronics store, they are also known as a 'Type-B USB cable'.\n\nCustomer:\nIf I'm using Windows 10 x64 and the TD-1DMK, what USB cable type do I need?\n\nAgent:\nThat's the one you'll need, a USB-B cable.\n\nCustomer:\nThank you for your help.\n\nCustomer:\nI'll probably subscribe to the annual plan soon, after your clarification.\n\nAgent:\nSure, no problem, take your time.\n\nCustomer:\nAnd is it possible to connect to the TD-1DMK using an iPad?\n\nAgent:\nYes, you can connect your TD-1 to your iPad. You'll need a USB-A to Lightning adapter for that, similar to this one: [URL]. There are setup guides on our website to help with that as well.\n\nCustomer:\nCan I connect the iPad to the TD-1DMK by Bluetooth, as I've seen some that can use a Bluetooth connection?\n\nAgent:\nTo my knowledge, the TD-1 doesn't have Bluetooth. It's best to check your user manual for confirmation.\n\nCustomer:\nOk, thanks. When does the special offer end?\n\nAgent:\nThe special offer ends on Wednesday this week.",
    "Agent:\nHello, thank you for contacting MusicBird Support. My name is [NAME]. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there. I'm a bit confused about my subscription dates. Could you please check something for me?\n\nAgent:\nSure, I'd be happy to help. Can you provide me with the details?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, so my annual subscription should have started on December 29th, 2020, and end on December 29th, 2021, right? But I paid for a year in advance, which seems to overlap with the dates you have on record.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, I understand. Let me verify the details of your subscription. Just a moment.\n\nCustomer:\nThank you bigtime!\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I've looked into it and it seems like there has been a mix-up. I see that your renewal date has now been amended to February 5th, 2022. Everything should be updated on your account accordingly.\n\nCustomer:\nBut shouldn't it be around mid-June, since the additional subscription was added to my current one?\n\nAgent:\nLet me double-check that for you. I apologize for the confusion; we'll sort this out.\n\nCustomer:\nAnd, uh, I'm also interested in a lifetime subscription if that's possible.\n\nAgent:\nI see, we can certainly discuss that option once we've clarified your current subscription dates. So for your subscription, the initial period was from February 5th, 2020 to February 5th, 2021. Then you paid in advance for the renewal on December 29th, 2020, which covers February 5th, 2021 to February 5th, 2022.\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I'm sorry to bother you again, [NAME]. The thing is, those calculations still aren't adding up for me. I've made detailed calculations on my end and I really want to help sort this out.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, got it. If you have the details handy, you can share them with me, and I'll have a look.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, I've actually sent an excel and PDF with all the information. I'm really hoping for that lifetime subscription offer too, for 333.33 USD.\n\nAgent:\nUnderstood. I've received your files and what you're proposing. Thank you for the detailed info. I'll need to discuss this with our finance and sales team regarding the lifetime subscription. Please bear with me, I appreciate your patience.\n\nCustomer:\nThank you. I'm a big fan of MusicBird and just want to make sure this is all clear. I'd also recommend setting up a system for loyal customers like me for automated discounts on renewals.\n\nAgent:\nOf course, [NAME]. Your feedback is very valuable and I will pass it along to our team. After reviewing the Excel and talking to the team, I've extended your subscription renewal date to June 23rd, 2022 as it should be. We hope this resolves the issue.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks, I really appreciate you taking the time to fix this.\n\nAgent:\nIt's my pleasure. And thank you for your kind words and for being such a loyal fan of MusicBird. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to us. Keep enjoying your practice!\n\nCustomer:\nWill do. Have a great day, [NAME]!",
    "Agent:\nHello, you've reached MusicBird customer support, how can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm a subscriber and I want to renew for another year at the sale price. Can you help me with that?\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, I'd be glad to help! First, you need to update your payment information. I can send you a secure link via email, or you can log into your account on our website to make the update. Could you let me know once that's done?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, sure thing.\n\nAgent:\nGreat, let me know once you're ready for the next step.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, I've updated the payment method.\n\nAgent:\nFantastic, [NAME]. So, let me just pull up your account. Okay, I see your payment update.\n\nCustomer:\nAnd. can you renew it at the sale price now?\n\nAgent:\nApologies for not confirming earlier. I'm checking. Oh, wait, you're in luck, [NAME]! There's actually a better offer than the sale price available for your renewal.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, really?\n\nAgent:\nYes, the next billing is set for June 13th, and the amount would be USD 99.88. That's a nice saving there!\n\nCustomer:\nAwesome! Good looking out, [NAME]! Thanks for the savings!\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome, [NAME]! Happy to help. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out. Enjoy your music!\n\nCustomer:\nWill do. Take care, bye!",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, [NAME]. This is [NAME] from MusicBird Customer Support. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi [NAME], this is [NAME]. I'm having trouble with latency in the lessons, and I'm not sure what's wrong. I've tried lowering the sample resolution, but it's still not working in real time.\n\nAgent:\nI see. Can you tell me what audio interface and keyboard you're using?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I'm using the RME UCX Fireface interface and a Radium 61-key keyboard.\n\nAgent:\nOk, and are these connected directly to your computer?\n\nCustomer:\nThe Fireface is connected via USB and the keyboard is plugged into its MIDI input.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. And what about your speakers? How are you connecting those?\n\nCustomer:\nI use Adam A5X speakers. They're connected to my interface.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, and have you made sure that all your audio drivers and firmware for your interface are up to date?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, everything's up to date. I'm also running on Windows 10, with 24 GB of RAM.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, and in the MusicBird settings, which audio output device have you selected?\n\nCustomer:\nI've selected the RME Fireface as my output.\n\nAgent:\nOk, have you had a chance to look at the 'reducing latency' section in our audio setup guide?\n\nCustomer:\nI did look at it, but it wasn't much help, unfortunately.\n\nAgent:\nSorry to hear that. One more thing that could help is installing ASIO4ALL drivers. Have you tried that?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I haven't done that yet.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, I recommend trying the ASIO4ALL drivers to see if it reduces the latency. Could you install it and see if it improves your experience?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I can give that a shot.\n\nAgent:\nFantastic. Please let me know how you get on after that, and we can take it from there.\n\nCustomer:\nWill do, [NAME]. Thanks for the help.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for calling MusicBird Customer Support. My name is [NAME], how can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there, I subscribed yesterday, but even today the lessons aren\u2019t unlocked\u2026\n\nAgent:\nOh, I'm really sorry to hear you\u2019re having trouble, [NAME]. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s going on. You mentioned you already tried logging out and back in, correct?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I did that, but it didn\u2019t help.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, let's check that for you. Can you hold for just a moment while I look into your account?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I\u2019ll wait.\n\nAgent:\nThank you for your patience, [NAME]. It looks like your subscription is active on our end now. Could you try logging in once again and see if that works for you?\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, give me a second to try this\u2026 No, it\u2019s still the same. The lessons are not unlocked.\n\nAgent:\nHmm, that's concerning. Which device and operating system are you using?\n\nCustomer:\nI'm on a Windows 10 device.\n\nAgent:\nUnderstood. Let\u2019s try clearing some local data to refresh your app\u2019s state. What I'm going to do is send you a file to run that'll help with this issue. It won't affect your progress, but it may reset any custom settings you have. Is that okay?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, that's fine with me. As long as I can get to the lessons.\n\nAgent:\nGreat, I'm sending the file over now. Please close MusicBird completely before you run it, and give it a little time when you restart the app \u2013 about five minutes. It needs to redownload some data.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, I've got the file. Running it now\u2026\n\nAgent:\nPerfect, let me know how it goes once it\u2019s done.\n\nCustomer:\nJust a moment\u2026 Wow, it\u2019s working now, and it\u2019s amazing! Thank you so much, [NAME]. You've been a great help.\n\nAgent:\nThat\u2019s fantastic news, [NAME]! I'm thrilled to hear everything is working fine now. If you need any more assistance, don't hesitate to contact us. Have a wonderful time with your lessons, and have a great weekend!\n\nCustomer:\nThanks, you too. Take care!",
    "Agent:\nHello and thanks for reaching out to MusicBird Support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm having trouble with my hi hat on MusicBird. It's registering misplayed notes even though I see the hit as green with the red dot. I'm not sure what's causing it since I'm not seeing other hits on the drum module. Is there some way to see what MusicBird thinks I hit?\n\nAgent:\nOh, I'm really sorry to hear you're having trouble with that. Can I ask if your playing surface might be a bit bouncy, or have you checked your playing style? These can sometimes lead to over-sensitivity.\n\nCustomer:\nHmm, I don't think it's the playing surface. I play softly, and the pad doesn't seem overly bouncy. I even tightened it before playing. What else could it be?\n\nAgent:\nDo you possibly have any note repeat or arpeggiator functions turned on your controller? Also, have you tried testing your controller with other software?\n\nCustomer:\nNope, I don\u2019t use those functions. And yes, I've tested it, no issues with other software.\n\nAgent:\nUnderstood. Could you try a factory reset on your drum module and let me know if that makes a difference? Also, adjusting the sensitivity of your hi hat pad might help.\n\nCustomer:\nSure, I can try those. But how do I adjust the sensitivity?\n\nAgent:\nYou might need to refer to your user manual for specific instructions, but usually, there's a setting within the module to change that.\n\nCustomer:\nGot it, I'll give that a shot and let you know.\n\nAgent:\nPerfect, please do keep me updated. I'm here to help!\n\nCustomer:\nLooks like adjusting the sensitivity did the trick. Thanks for all your help!",
    "Agent:\nHello and a very Happy Wednesday to you!\n\nCustomer:\nHey there! My name is [NAME], just reaching out with a suggestion.\n\nAgent:\nGreat to hear from you, [NAME]! Go ahead, I\u2019m all ears.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, so I was practicing with \"Bounce It \" by OddKidOut and uh, see, he's got this hand-over-hand technique.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh.\n\nCustomer:\nBut if you don\u2019t follow him, it might be confusing. So, I was thinking why not include videos of 3 Star performances in lessons for a better visual on the techniques and stuff.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I see what you mean. Visual examples, right?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, exactly! Videos by the artists themselves or someone well-versed in MusicBird. I think it\u2019d really help out, especially for visual learners.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, that's a really interesting idea, [NAME]! Have you had a chance to check out the BeatsbyJblack mini-course we released?\n\nCustomer:\nUh, yeah [NAME], I did look at those. It\u2019s kind of like what I\u2019m suggesting but, let me clarify.\n\nAgent:\nSure, please do.\n\nCustomer:\nSo imagine a side-by-side layout with the live performance and a diagram. Or even a pop-up video in the lesson itself.\n\nAgent:\nAh, more integrated into the lesson rather than as a standalone feature.\n\nCustomer:\nYes, exactly that! It could really boost engagement and trust in the MusicBird brand, you know?\n\nAgent:\nI understand, it\u2019s about adding value to the lessons themselves. Let me make sure I pass this on to the team. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's pretty much it. I better get back to practicing now.\n\nAgent:\nSounds good, [NAME]. We really appreciate your feedback. Have fun practicing and have a great weekend!\n\nCustomer:\nYou too, [NAME]. Take care!",
    "Agent:\nHello, this is [NAME] from MusicBird support. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi [NAME], I'm [NAME]. I've got an issue with my drum module. My Kick doesn't work anymore, and I suspect the problem is with the module itself.\n\nAgent:\nI see, [NAME]. Have you been able to try any troubleshooting steps yourself before reaching out to us?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I actually bought a new Alesis nitro mesh drum module off eBay. It should be arriving by June 7th. I plan to see if it resolves my issue then.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, that's good to hear you've got a replacement on the way. In the meantime, could you look at our drum troubleshooting guide and see if anything there might help? Also, have you tried resetting all mappings in the MusicBird settings?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I followed the guide, but no luck. And I've used different cables, midi to USB, swapped connectors - like from Bass Drum to Snare or Toms. Still nothing. My current module's from a brand called Goedrum, and it's been hard to get support from them.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, so some testing has been done. It could be that your Goedrum module is sending a different MIDI note from what MusicBird expects. Can you see what MIDI notes your module is sending out?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, I don't have that information right now, but I'll check it when my new module arrives. Thanks for the help, [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, [NAME]. Let me know once the new module arrives and if there's anything else you need. We're here to help you get back to playing as soon as possible.\n\nCustomer:\nI will, [NAME]. Appreciate your support. Have a good one.",
    "Agent:\nHi there, thanks for contacting customer support. My name is [NAME]. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi [NAME]. My Alesis turbo drum kit isn't working with MusicBird. I've got it connected, the driver's updated, it's all plugged in via USB, but when I hit the drums, MusicBird isn't registering any hits, even though it sees my kit. I've restarted my PC, checked the cables, but nothing's working.\n\nAgent:\nI apologize for the inconvenience. Let's see if we can get this sorted out for you. Could you try looking at our drums troubleshooting guide first and let me know if that resolves the issue?\n\nCustomer:\nI've checked the troubleshooting guide already. The issue is I can't even access the 'revert all mappings' option in MusicBird since I'm setting it up for the first time.\n\nAgent:\nHmm, interesting. Let's try something different then. Can you disconnect your drum kit and go through the initial setup using just your computer keyboard, to see if the mappings will work afterwards?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, let me give it a shot.\n\nCustomer:\nNope, I went through the setup with my keyboard, but the drum kit still isn't showing up in that dropdown menu. MusicBird doesn't seem to recognize it, but my PC does, under devices. I'm really short on time, is there maybe a customer service chat I can use?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's pretty frustrating not getting a response right away.\n\nAgent:\nI'm truly sorry for the delay in response, I'm not here 24/7, but I want to help you resolve this. Would you mind attempting to map your controller in the settings and also perform a factory reset on your drum kit?\n\nCustomer:\nSorry for my earlier message, I must've messaged you right at the end of your shift. I tried what you suggested, but there's still no detection of my drums in MusicBird. The drum kit is recognized as 'Alesis Turbo' on my computer and the drivers are all up to date.\n\nAgent:\nNo worries, I understand your frustration. Did you happen to download any drivers from the Alesis website? Also, can you make sure nothing else is running that might interfere? And could you try downloading a program called MIDI-OX to check if the drum kit is sending notes to your computer?\n\nCustomer:\nThere weren't any drivers to download on the Alesis site, it just prompted me to register the product and then said I needed your software. I'll download MIDI-OX now and give it a go.\n\nCustomer:\nSo, MIDI-OX isn't picking up any signals from the drum kit, even though it's connected, and my PC says so.\n\nCustomer:\nWait, I got MIDI-OX to recognize the drum kit, but MusicBird still doesn't.\n\nAgent:\nLet's try clearing all local data from MusicBird, which could potentially fix this issue. I'll send you a file to run after you close the app completely. You won't lose progress, but you'll need to remap any custom settings. After you restart the app, give it about five minutes as it re-downloads everything. Let me know if that works for you.",
    "Agent:\nHi, thank you for calling MusicBird support. My name is [NAME]. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, my computer is recognizing my drum kit, but the MusicBird program isn't.\n\nAgent:\nOh, I see. Can you please tell me which drum kit you're using? And have you already set the drums as your instrument in the program?\n\nCustomer:\nRight, I selected drums in the settings. My drum kit is the Alesis Turbo Mesh Head.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, got it. Have you already tried clicking the \"revert all mappings\" button in the settings?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I did that, but it still won't find my drum kits even though my computer does.\n\nAgent:\nHmm. If you're using a MIDI to USB interface, have you installed all necessary drivers from the manufacturer's website?\n\nCustomer:\nDrivers? Uh, I'm not sure. I'll have to check that.\n\nAgent:\nIt's quite important to have the latest drivers for proper connectivity. Also, on your drum kit, check the MIDI Settings. You'll want the GM setting to be ON and LOC to be OFF. Can you confirm if that's done?\n\nCustomer:\nHold on, I\u2019m looking. Okay, GM is ON and LOC is OFF now.\n\nAgent:\nGreat. Now make sure the MIDI is sending on channel 10. That's typically the channel for drums.\n\nCustomer:\nGot it, setting it to channel 10.\n\nAgent:\nPerfect. If some drums still aren't working, try resetting your module to factory settings.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, I'll try resetting it. Let's hope that works. Thanks for your help.\n\nAgent:\nNo problem at all. If you face any more issues, don't hesitate to give us a call back. Have a great day!\n\nCustomer:\nWill do. Thanks, [NAME]. Goodbye.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for calling MusicBird support. This is [NAME] speaking, how may I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi [NAME], I recently got charged for an annual subscription renewal but my account still shows the old expiry date, could you help me with that?\n\nAgent:\nSure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can you please tell me the date that is currently displayed in your account?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, it says May 25th, 2021, but it's supposed to be May 25th, 2022, as I was just charged the annual fee.\n\nAgent:\nI see. Just to confirm, you've seen the transaction for the renewal come out of your bank account, correct?\n\nCustomer:\nYep, that's correct, $149.88 for the renewal.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. Could you try logging out and logging back in for me? Sometimes there is a delay in updating the system.\n\nCustomer:\nI already did that, actually, and the date didn't change. Still shows last year's date.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, let's try something else. Are you able to access all your content on MusicBird without any issues?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, no trouble accessing content, just the expiry date is wrong.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, could you try going into the settings in your MusicBird app, then hit 'Edit Account' under the Account tab for me?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, give me a sec. Okay, done, but the expiry date is still 2021.\n\nAgent:\nHmm, that's peculiar. Well, I appreciate you trying those steps. I'll forward this to our technical team to take a closer look.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks, [NAME]. I'll wait to hear back then.\n\nAgent:\nNot a problem, [NAME]. If the date corrects itself in the meantime, please give us a call to let us know.\n\nCustomer:\nWill do.\n\nAgent:\nAnother thing you could try in the meantime is clearing your web browser's cache and data or trying a different browser to log in. It might refresh the account details.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, I can try that. Probably just a cache issue or something.\n\nAgent:\nYeah, that might be it. Give it a shot, and let's hope it refreshes the details. If there's anything else I can assist you with, feel free to call us back.\n\nCustomer:\nWill do, thanks.",

I think my membership must be pretty much expired. Is there any way you could extend it for the time I missed?\n\nAgent:\nFirst, I'm glad to hear you're back. I'm really sorry, but our system only allows for a maximum extension of three months. Would you like me to add that to your account?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, please, that would be amazing.\n\nAgent:\nGreat, bear with me one moment while I add that for you.\n\nCustomer:\nThank you.

Some lessons are too slow, and I can't get any better scores, but others don't seem to register my hits at all. It doesn't feel reliable.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. And what about your experience with playing hi-hat and ride?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, for those, I found if I use the tip of the drum stick, it hardly registers. But if I use the fat end, it seems to hit most times. It feels like I'm gaming the system.\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, so it's not matching up with actual drum playing.\n\nCustomer:\nExactly. And another thing, there are no real songs to play along with. It's just lessons.\n\nAgent:\nI understand. We do appreciate this kind of feedback.\n\nCustomer:\nSure. Oh, and I emailed you earlier about a problem with double triggering. Waiting for a response on that.\n\nAgent:\nYep, we've received your email about that. We're looking into it.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks. But the main thing is, without drum notation in the lessons, whatever I learn doesn't really carry over to real playing, you know?\n\nAgent:\nYes, [NAME], I get what you're saying. I'll pass this along to our team. Anything else?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's all a bit technical, takes away the fun and feeling of playing real drums.\n\nAgent:\nUnderstood. This is valuable insight for us.\n\nCustomer:\nAll lessons with symbols just don't work well, and I think it's a problem with the app's coding, not my drumming.\n\nAgent:\nAll lessons, huh? Okay, we'll look into that for sure.\n\nCustomer:\nRight, and the app's not picking up on the crash symbol at all.\n\nAgent:\nSorry to hear that, [NAME]. Let me make a note of that too.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks. And it's unrealistic having to hit notes with such precision. Musicians miss notes in real life!\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I understand your frustration. We try to balance the lessons with some tolerance, but I'll mention this to our developers.\n\nCustomer:\nIt just seems too strict and artificial compared to actual drumming.\n\nAgent:\nFeedback like yours is really helpful to us, [NAME]. Do you have anything specific you'd like us to address?\n\nCustomer:\nJust get it more in line with real drumming, not playing a game. And the crash symbol issue is annoying.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. We'll conduct a review and see what improvements can be made there.\n\nCustomer:\nI hope so. I mean, it's frustrating when it feels more difficult than learning from a book, you know?\n\nAgent:\nI totally understand. We'll work on making the experience better. Thank you for your patience, [NAME].\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, thanks. I'm looking forward to seeing some changes. Goodbye.",
    "Agent:\nHi, thank you for contacting support, how can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nI can't sync Arturia 32 step with the software. Help.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, sorry to hear you're having issues. Have you tried hitting the 'revert all mappings' button in the MusicBird settings?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I haven't.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, please try that and then select the default mapping for your controller in the 'selected device' dropdown menu.\n\nCustomer:\nGive me a moment. I've done that now.\n\nAgent:\nGreat, and are you seeing that your keyboard starts on note [NAME]?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, that's right.\n\nAgent:\nRemember, MusicBird always displays an on-screen keyboard starting on note C, but it won't affect the notes you play. If necessary, use the octave-shifting function on your keyboard to get into the right key range.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, I see. That makes sense.\n\nAgent:\nGood to hear! Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nCustomer:\nThank you for your reply. Just one more question: Can I use the same subscription on my laptop and iPad?\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! And yes, you can use your subscription on multiple devices, just make sure not to have MusicBird open on both at the same time to avoid any syncing issues.\n\nCustomer:\nGreat, thanks. And how do I avoid progress issues?\n\nAgent:\nJust make sure you close MusicBird between each practice session. On your iPad, use the App Switcher to fully close the app.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, got it. Thanks, [NAME]!\n\nAgent:\nNo problem at all, [NAME]. Happy to help. If you need anything else, just let us know. Have a great day!",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for calling customer support. My name is [NAME]. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I just paid an annual subscription and noticed my PayPal account was charged twice. I need some help with this.\n\nAgent:\nOh, I see. I'm really sorry to hear that there was an issue with your payment. Let's take a closer look at this together. Could you tell me if you've received any email confirmations or notices about these charges?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I have both the charges on my credit card statement and on my PayPal account. This happened once before when I canceled my subscription.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, okay. Have you by any chance sent us any screenshots of these transactions so that I can better understand the issue?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I sent those earlier along with my PayPal statement. There's also a reversed transaction but it's still showing on my credit card statement.\n\nAgent:\nRight, thanks for that information. It seems like the charge you're referring to may just be a pending transaction on PayPal's end. They typically reverse themselves within a few days. But just to be sure, I'll escalate this to our payments team to investigate further. Alright?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, please do. I'll keep an eye on it and let you know if there's any change.\n\nCustomer:\nHello again, [NAME]. Unfortunately, the charge is still showing on my credit card. Can you guys do anything about this?\n\nAgent:\nI'm sorry to hear that the charge is still there. Just to confirm, has the charge been posted to your account or is it still pending?\n\nCustomer:\nBoth PayPal and my bank have confirmed that the charge went through. Can you look into it using the PayPal transaction ID?\n\nAgent:\nCertainly, I'll need to review the details with our payments team to track down this issue. I'm going to need a few moments to dig into this, is that alright?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, that works. Thanks for checking.\n\nAgent:\nThank you so much for your patience. I've just had a word with our payments team, and they have located the extra charge from the canceled subscription. We are issuing a refund for that now. Apologies for the oversight, and thank you for your understanding.\n\nCustomer:\nThat's great news, [NAME]! I've got an email from PayPal confirming the refund is on its way. Thank you so much for sorting that out.\n\nAgent:\nYou're very welcome! I'm glad we could resolve that for you. If there's anything else you need, just let me know.\n\nCustomer:\nActually, there is one more thing. Does MusicBird have any partnership with Ableton?\n\nAgent:\nYes, we do have a collaboration with Ableton. You can find all the details on their tutorial blog where we have a feature. If you'd like more information, I can send you a link to the article.\n\nCustomer:\nThat would be excellent, thanks!",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for calling MusicBird Support. My name's [NAME]. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm a bit confused about my yearly subscription. I want to make sure it doesn't auto-renew. Can you help me with that?\n\nAgent:\nSure, I can help with that. Could you please provide me the email address associated with your account?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, it's [EMAIL_ADDRESS].\n\nAgent:\nGot it, thank you. Just to confirm, you're looking to prevent your subscription from auto-renewing, right?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, exactly. I just want it to end after the current year is up without renewing.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I see. Well, all MusicBird subscriptions renew automatically. However, you can cancel your subscription at any time, and you'll retain access until the end of your subscription period.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, but when I was checking the cancellation, there was a warning about losing my discount. What's that about?\n\nAgent:\nOh, if you decide to renew later on, I assure you we will honor your current discount. Nothing to worry about there.\n\nCustomer:\nWait, but I don't want to renew. I just want this year to finish and then no more charges. So if I cancel right now, no negative effects on my current subscription?\n\nAgent:\nCorrect, no repercussions at all. You can cancel now and still enjoy your yearly membership until it's set to expire. You won't be billed again.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, that's a relief. Thanks for clearing that up for me.\n\nAgent:\nNo problem at all! Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's everything. Thanks, [NAME].",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for contacting customer support, this is [NAME] speaking. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I have a Linnstrument, which is a grid-based instrument. I'm facing an issue\u2014I'd like to try a piano course with it, but when I plug it in, it defaults to a drum pad layout. Could you tell me if it's possible to do the piano course with this kind of instrument?\n\nAgent:\nI see. Just to confirm, you're trying to use your Linnstrument and it's not mapping correctly for piano courses, is that right?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, that's correct. It always goes to drums, and I need it to behave like a piano.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. Let me check what we can do. Please give me a moment.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, thanks.\n\nAgent:\nOkay [NAME], so here's what we've got. The piano mappings we use follow the General MIDI standard. This means middle C would be MIDI value 60 and if your Linnstrument's pads are in ascending order, you might be able to map it out.\n\nCustomer:\nHow exactly would I do that?\n\nAgent:\nSure, so you'll use the \"map your controller\" feature. Hit the lowest pad, then the highest pad, make sure they are in order. Also, make sure that you have selected 'keys' as your instrument in the settings.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, I'll give that a try then. And what if it doesn't work?\n\nAgent:\nIf it doesn't work, let us know. We're here to help you sort it out or we can look into it further if needed.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, I appreciate the help. I'll try that and get back to you.\n\nAgent:\nYou\u2019re welcome, [NAME]! Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or need further assistance. Have a great day!\n\nCustomer:\nThank you, [NAME]. You've been very helpful. Goodbye for now.",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for calling MusicBird support. My name is [NAME]. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there, I have a question about your subscriptions. I saw that there's a promo for three free months if I sign up for a monthly plan. But I'm actually interested in the annual plan that's currently on sale. What I'm wondering is, if I sign up for the three free months and then switch to the annual plan the next day, will I lose the remaining free months or will the annual subscription start after the free period ends?\n\nAgent:\nAlright, I understand what you're asking. Can you tell me, did you see an option for the free months on the annual plan too, or just on the monthly?\n\nCustomer:\nJust on the monthly.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, got it. Now, typically with our service, if you start with a monthly plan and then switch to an annual, the change would normally happen on your renewal date. Did you happen to use any promotional code from a product for the free trial?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, actually, I bought a Roli SongMaker Kit a while back and I think it had a promo code for two free three-month trials.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, thank you for that information. Do you remember where you bought the SongMaker Kit from?\n\nCustomer:\nI think it was directly from your website.\n\nAgent:\nGreat, so here's the thing: if you start with the three-month free trial, you'll need to let that run before shifting to an annual subscription. If you switch immediately after starting the monthly, your annual subscription would kick in and you might lose the free months.\n\nCustomer:\nSo if I understand correctly, I should wait until the three-month trial is almost up before I change to the annual plan?\n\nAgent:\nExactly. If you make the switch just before the trial ends, your annual subscription will start right after the monthly trial period. And remember, you can always reach out to us to make the change manually if you're unsure about the timing.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, that makes sense. Thanks for the help, [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nNot a problem at all, I'm glad I could assist you. If you have any other questions later, feel free to contact us. Have a great day!\n\nCustomer:\nYou too, bye.",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for contacting MusicBird support. My name is [NAME]. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi there, my MusicBird app isn't working with my Roland TD-1 drum kit on my iPad.\n\nAgent:\nI'm sorry to hear about the trouble you're having. Let's see if we can sort this out together. Have you had a chance to check our iPad connection guide?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, my connections seem fine, but I'm not sure about the mapping for my drum kit.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. Could you please try tapping on \"revert all mappings\" in the MusicBird settings and then try selecting the mapping for your controller from the dropdown menu?\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, I'll give that a go. Just to clarify, my drum kit has 4 pads on top, a snare, 3 toms, and a bass drum. Does that matter for the mapping?\n\nAgent:\nThanks for the details, [NAME]. Can you tell me what instrument you currently have selected in the top left-hand corner of the app? Make sure you\u2019ve chosen 'drums' when trying to connect your TD-1.\n\nCustomer:\nLet me check. Yes, I have 'drums' selected there.\n\nAgent:\nPerfect. Once you have 'drums' selected, try to reconnect your TD-1 and see if it responds appropriately.\n\nCustomer:\nIt still doesn't seem to be working correctly.\n\nAgent:\nI see. Could you please tell me the specific pattern or mapping option you're choosing for the kit?\n\nCustomer:\nIt's a bit confusing; I'm not sure what pattern to choose for my specific setup.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, don\u2019t worry, we'll figure this out. For a kit like yours, you might need a custom pattern. I think it's best if we look at this together. Can I set up a call with our technical team to walk you through the process?\n\nCustomer:\nThat would be great, thank you.\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! I'll arrange that for you. In the meantime, please keep your iPad and TD-1 ready so we can troubleshoot effectively on the call. Is there a particular time that works best for you?\n\nCustomer:\nAfternoon would be best for me.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, I'll schedule it for this afternoon then. We'll send you a confirmation email with the details shortly.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks for your help, [NAME].",
    "Agent:\nHi, this is [NAME] from MusicBird support. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi [NAME], I'm [NAME]. It's taking forever for the lessons to load on my app. Is there any way to fix this?\n\nAgent:\nI'm sorry to hear that, [NAME]. We can try clearing all local data to speed things up. Have you tried that before?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I haven't. Could you guide me through that?\n\nAgent:\nSure. First, make sure that MusicBird is completely shut down. Then, I'll need you to download and run a small file. This won't affect your progress but will reset any custom controller mappings. Is that alright?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, I can do that. What about my controller mappings though?\n\nAgent:\nYou'll have to remap them afterwards. I can help you with that if you need.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, I guess that's fine. What's next?\n\nAgent:\nGreat, when you restart the app afterward, there might be a slight delay while everything is being downloaded again. Usually, no more than five minutes. Could you try that and let me know how it goes?\n\nCustomer:\nI will, but. oh, it looks like my Windows Security won't let me run the file.\n\nAgent:\nAh, those security pop-ups can be a hindrance, yes. You might need to adjust your settings temporarily or check some permissions.\n\nCustomer:\nGot it, I'll give that a go, and I'll update you as soon as I can.\n\nAgent:\nPerfect, [NAME]. Also, make sure your internet connection is stable, and you're not running any VPNs or firewalls that might block the connection.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, I'll check those as well. Thanks, [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome, [NAME]. Reach out if you need more help.\n\nCustomer:\nHi again, [NAME]. Turns out it was my internet provider causing the trouble. It's all fixed now. Thanks for the help!\n\nAgent:\nHey [NAME], that's great news! I'm glad to hear it's working for you now. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to contact us if you need assistance with anything else. Enjoy your music lessons!\n\nCustomer:\nWill do, thanks again, [NAME].",
    "Agent:\nHi there! Thank you for reaching out to our support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHello, I'm struggling with connecting my Alesis crimson II kit to my iPad. It used to work before, but now there are some mapping issues with the drum triggers.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, I understand. Could you tell me a bit more about the specific issues you're having with the drum triggers?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, the Hi Tom and Open Hi-Hat are not responding at all. Also, when I use the Hi Hat pedal, it causes a response, but not when I strike with a stick while the pedal is depressed.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. Have you tried doing a factory reset of the controller or checked your connections again?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, done all that. Reset the controller, connected everything in the correct order; but still facing the same issues.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, understood. It's strange that some parts are working while others aren't. This could mean that your kit might not be sending the standard MIDI values. Have you changed anything on your kit that might have affected this?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, haven't changed anything. It was fine four months ago. Also, if this helps, the pads seem to be recognized by MusicBird in lesson mode but not in preset or manual mapping mode.\n\nAgent:\nI see. So you can play fine in lesson mode, but in the preplay or mapping screen, the triggers don't respond?\n\nCustomer:\nCorrect, only the triggers I mentioned earlier aren't working.\n\nAgent:\nAlright. Now when you map your kit in MusicBird, you should typically hit a drum to let it detect the MIDI note. Maybe it's a case where it's not detecting the specific triggers properly. Have you checked if all connections are secure, and the GM settings on your Crimson II are turned on?\n\nCustomer:\nYep, checked all that. Connections are secure, and GM settings are on. Still the same problem.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, it does sound like a tricky situation. It might indeed be a glitch in the MusicBird app as you suggested. I would advise reaching out to their support team or seeing if there\u2019s an update available, which might fix the issue.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, will do that. Thanks for the support, though. I appreciate it.",
    "Agent:\nHello, thank you for contacting MusicBird customer support. This is [NAME]. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm having trouble with my electronic drum from Alesis. When I play, sometimes I can't tell if there's latency or if I'm off-beat. It's really frustrating.\n\nAgent:\nHey [NAME], sorry to hear you're experiencing latency issues. I can definitely help with that. Can we start by getting some information about your audio setup? What kind of headphones or speakers are you using, and how are they connected?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, I'm using a Samsung soundbar that's connected to my TV through an HDMI ARC cable, and then my TV is hooked up to my computer through another HDMI cable.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, thanks. It sounds like there might be input lag from the TV to the soundbar. Have you tried connecting the soundbar directly to your computer?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I haven't done that yet. Do you think that could help with the latency?\n\nAgent:\nYeah, it's definitely worth a try. Also, have you had a chance to look at our audio setup guide, especially the part about reducing latency?\n\nCustomer:\nI haven't had a chance to look at that yet. Is it possible for you to extend my trial subscription while I test out the direct connection?\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, [NAME]. I'll extend your trial by a week so you can have some extra time to work this out.\n\nCustomer:\nThank you! That's really helpful.\n\nAgent:\nAnytime, [NAME]. Be sure to let me know how it goes or if you have any other questions. Remember, we're here to help.\n\nCustomer:\nActually, I didn't get to test it yet. Can you extend my trial again?\n\nAgent:\nHey [NAME]! Sure thing, I can set up another one-week trial for you. Give it a try and reach out if you need assistance.\n\nCustomer:\nSorry, I still didn't get a chance to try it out. I'm planning to do it today. Can we extend the trial one more time?\n\nAgent:\nHi [NAME], no worries at all. I'll arrange for another week of trial time on your account. Just keep us updated on your progress.\n\nAgent:\nHi [NAME], checking in\u2014how did it go with the trial? Any improvements with the setup, or do you have any questions?\n\nCustomer:\nActually, I've been pretty busy and haven't got around to trying it yet.",

It's just gotten too expensive.\n\nAgent:\nOh, I see. I'm really sorry to hear that you're considering cancellation. Besides the cost, is there any other feedback or suggestions you have for MusicBird that could make your experience better?\n\nCustomer:\nYeah, actually. I was thinking you could add some sort of online multiplayer feature, you know, for more community interaction.\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm.\n\nCustomer:\nAnd maybe more jokes for when you get a perfect play, those are always fun. Oh, and what about licensing out your controller interfacing layer?\n\nAgent:\nAh, okay.\n\nCustomer:\nAlso, if you could hire some teachers for live lessons within the app, it might make the subscription more worthwhile. You know, sell lessons for keeps. It's not like your service is worth twice as much as Netflix.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, [NAME]. Thanks for sharing those ideas. While we don't have those features at the moment, I'll ensure your suggestions are passed on to our development team. They would be really valuable for future updates.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, sounds good. But I still want to cancel for now.\n\nAgent:\nSure, I understand. Let's go ahead and process that cancellation for you. Can I have your account information, please?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, it's [NAME] , email is [EMAIL_ADDRESS]\n\nAgent:\nThank you, [NAME].

There's nothing in my account, and I need to know the annual subscription fee for renewal.\n\nAgent:\nOh, I see. You should be able to view your subscription details by logging into the account page on our website, or in the SETTINGS>ACCOUNT section of our app. Have you tried this?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, I've looked there, but it doesn't show the information on the next billing amount. It might be good to add that feature. Also, I was expecting a discount on my renewal.?\n\nAgent:\nUnderstood, let me just check the details for you. All right, so your next billing date is set for January 1st, and the amount will be $149.88. Does that help?\n\nCustomer:\nActually, where you are mentioning now, there is no information about the billing amount. And about that amount, shouldn't there be a discount applied from when I first signed up?\n\nAgent:\nUh-huh, let me look into that for you. Oh, I see here that you did have a promotional price for your first year. Let me adjust this on our end. Okay, I've now applied a 25% off promotion to your account. Your renewed price will be $112.41. Is that better?\n\nCustomer:\nThanks for adding the discount. But really, the account screen does show no billing amount. And I do suggest to provide an invoice for each purchase. It's a requirement in many European countries, just FYI.\n\nAgent:\nI appreciate the feedback and the recommendation, that's really helpful. We're actually working on streamlining the account section as we speak. Thanks for the screenshot and your suggestions!\n\nCustomer:\nYou're welcome. It would just make things easier.

This might be why there's a bit of confusion.\n\nCustomer:\nOk.\n\nAgent:\nI can go ahead and reset the passwords for you to try and resolve this. But before I do, do you wish to keep all these accounts?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, because I have two launchpads with two promo codes.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. So you'd like to use both promo codes. Now, just to clarify, are you asking to merge these promo codes into one account?\n\nCustomer:\nIf possible, yeah. If you could apply the two different promo codes together in the same account, I'd appreciate it. If you can't, then just leave it as it is. Thanks.\n\nAgent:\nSure, I can look into that for you.

I'm having trouble with sound delays on my iPad when I play my V-Drums. Can you help?\n\nAgent:\nHi [NAME]. Sure, I'll do my best to help you with this. Can you tell me what type of headphones or speakers you're using, and if they're connected via cable or Bluetooth?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, I'm using a MIDI to USB C cable to connect my Roland TD07KV V-Drum to my iPad Air. There's a noticeable lag when I play.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. Have you gone into the MusicBird settings to see which audio output device is selected, and checked the latency settings there?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I haven't looked at that yet.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, would you mind checking that for me? Also, how about the latency slider in the settings. Is it all the way to the left?\n\nCustomer:\nUh, give me a second, I'll check. Yeah, the latency slider is all the way to the left.\n\nAgent:\nGreat. It could also be a cable issue. Sometimes if it's too long or if it's getting old, it can cause latency problems. Have you tried using a different USB cable or connecting directly with a USB to Lightning adapter?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I've just been using this one cable. I guess I can try another.\n\nAgent:\nYeah, I recommend trying a shorter or newer cable to see if that makes a difference. It's also important to note that Bluetooth connections tend to have more latency than wired ones, so a USB connection is usually more reliable for audio work.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, I'll try that. Anything else I should do?\n\nAgent:\nThat should be a good starting point. If the issue persists, feel free to get back to us, and we can take a further look into this.\n\nCustomer:\nAlright, thanks for the help, [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome, [NAME].

Just to confirm, you're planning to come back once things settle down, right?\n\nCustomer:\nYes, definitely! I plan on renewing my subscription as soon as I'm able to.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, great. I'll go ahead and process your cancellation request. And remember, we're here if you need any help or decide to come back sooner.\n\nCustomer:\nThank you, I really appreciate it. And believe me, MusicBird has been a dream for my music production. I will be back soon.\n\nAgent:\nThat's wonderful to hear, [NAME]. It means a lot to us that we could help with your music production journey. All the best with your move, and take care. We\u2019re looking forward to having you back with us when you\u2019re ready.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks a lot, [NAME]! Take care too, and see you soon.\n\nAgent:\nIt's been my pleasure. Should you need anything else or have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to contact us. Have a wonderful day!\n\nCustomer:\nYou too, bye now.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for calling MusicBird support. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, uh, yeah, I can't get my lesson to start on my computer. The app just isn't working right.\n\nAgent:\nI see, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me exactly what's happening when you try to start the lesson?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, when I click on the lesson, nothing happens. It\u2019s just stuck.\n\nAgent:\nGot it. And are the lessons showing as locked, or are you having any issues logging in, or maybe content isn't loading properly?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I can log in fine, but when I try to load the content it just doesn't do anything.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, let's try clearing all local data - it might fix the problem. Make sure you close the MusicBird app completely before you proceed. I can guide you through downloading a file that should help. Is that okay?\n\nCustomer:\nSure, yeah, I can do that. But what about my settings and stuff?\n\nAgent:\nYou won\u2019t lose any progress in your lessons, but if you've used the \"Map your controller\" feature, those settings will reset. You can remap afterwards though. Is that alright?\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, I guess that's fine.\n\nAgent:\nGreat. After you've run the file and start the app again, it might take a few minutes longer to load your lessons, because it's redownloading everything. Just a heads up.\n\nCustomer:\nOh, actually, you know what? I just remembered something.\n\nAgent:\nYes?\n\nCustomer:\nMy internet service had some issues earlier. And I think I might've switched tabs by accident too. It's probably why it wouldn\u2019t load.\n\nAgent:\nAh, I understand. That could definitely cause some problems.\n\nCustomer:\nIt's working fine now, though. Really sorry about that. I should\u2019ve checked before calling.\n\nAgent:\nNo trouble at all! That's what we're here for. If anything comes up again or if you need help with anything else, don't hesitate to reach out, okay?\n\nCustomer:\nWill do. Thanks again, and sorry for the confusion.",
    "Agent:\nHello and thank you for reaching out to us! How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi, I'm having some issues with my controller settings and also looking for some advice.\n\nAgent:\nI see. What seems to be the issue with your controller?\n\nCustomer:\nEvery time I sign in, I have to remap my controller. It doesn't save my settings, and I've already talked to tech support but no solution so far.\n\nAgent:\nOh, that sounds frustrating. Could you tell me which version of MusicBird you're currently using, please?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, I gave that info and the .json file to someone named Rhys before, but I can look it up again if you need it.\n\nAgent:\nThat would be great, thank you. And are you still unable to find the .json mapping file?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I found the file. I sent it last time. [NAME] told me to delete a Ccleaner file and reinstall MusicBird, but that didn't fix it.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, thanks for that information. Have you tried our keyboard troubleshooting guide by any chance?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I haven't tried that yet.\n\nAgent:\nAlright, I'd recommend going through the guide first. There's also a \"revert all mappings\" button in the settings, maybe give that a go and then try reselecting your controller mapping.\n\nCustomer:\nOkay, I can try that. And what about the ambient music part? The lessons don't seem to fit my interests.\n\nAgent:\nI understand. Currently, our lessons are more modern-focused, but I'll note down your preference for ambient music. Perhaps that's something we can look into for future updates.\n\nCustomer:\nThat would be great; I feel a bit left out with the current offerings.\n\nAgent:\nAbsolutely, I'll make sure to pass your feedback along. Please let us know how you get on with the mapping issue after trying the troubleshooting steps.\n\nCustomer:\nWill do. Thanks for your help, [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! And just to confirm, your name was?\n\nCustomer:\nOh, it\u2019s [NAME].\n\nAgent:\nGreat, [NAME]. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. If you need any more help, feel free to reach out. Have a good day!\n\nCustomer:\nYou too, bye.",
    "Agent:\nGood morning, thank you for calling MusicBird support. This is [NAME] speaking. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi [NAME]. I wanted to discuss the MusicBird app, specifically the drum interface. I'm having a hard time with it because I'm color blind and it's really not user-friendly for me. Why not make it similar to the piano interface? Also, it would be great to personalize it to match my real-life drum setup.\n\nAgent:\nOkay, I see. Have you tried using the High Contrast Mode in the settings? That could potentially help with discerning the correct and incorrect notes.\n\nCustomer:\nNo, I haven't tried that yet. But what about making the interface scroll down like the piano and matching it to my personal E-Drum setup, like the Alesis Strike Pro SE I own?\n\nAgent:\nMm-hmm, I understand what you're saying, and I'm sorry for the trouble you're experiencing. The concept of a vertically scrolling interface like the piano is certainly interesting. And personalizing the setup is a valid request.\n\nCustomer:\nYes, that's right. And my English isn't perfect, but I hope I'm making sense. It would just make the learning process more comfortable for me.\n\nAgent:\nYou're making perfect sense, don't worry. Your feedback is very valuable to us. We're actually looking into enhancing the drum features in the app, so I'll make sure your suggestions are passed on to our development team.\n\nCustomer:\nThanks, [NAME]. One more thing: I was thinking, wouldn't it be great if we could import our own songs, like a track from AC/DC, and have the app recognize the drum patterns?\n\nAgent:\nGot it. Adding the ability to import songs and having some song teaching aspect is something we're already considering for the future. Your idea of recognizing individual drum frequencies is quite intriguing. I'll be sure to bring this up with the team.\n\nCustomer:\nThat sounds promising. Thanks for your help and for listening to my suggestions.\n\nAgent:\nNo problem at all. I'm here to help. Thank you for taking the time to reach out to us. Your input is essential in helping us improve. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's all for now. Thanks again.\n\nAgent:\nYou're welcome! Have a great day, and feel free to contact us anytime if you have more questions or feedback. Goodbye!",
    "Agent:\nGood day! Thank you for contacting our support center. How may I assist you today?\n\nCustomer:\nHi! I would like to request a feature. It would be really helpful to have keyboard shortcuts to nudge the metronome while in exercise mode. Is that something you could add?\n\nAgent:\nAh, I see. We currently don't have that feature available. May I ask why you're interested in this particular functionality?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, I find it's more convenient to adjust the metronome speed in small increments without having to interrupt my flow to use the mouse. Just a simple key press to increase the tempo, just like in practice mode, would be super helpful.\n\nAgent:\nGot it, that does sound like a useful feature to have for a smoother practice session. I will definitely forward your suggestion to our development team.\n\nCustomer:\nThat's great, thank you! It would really enhance the experience.\n\nAgent:\nOf course! We appreciate your input and always look for ways to improve. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\nCustomer:\nNo, that's all for now. Thank you for your help, [NAME]."
